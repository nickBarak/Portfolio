A student must first provide documentation that all other options have been exhausted in order to qualify.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vouchers are meant to assist students that are suffering through a one-time housing emergency that could force them to relocate, jeopardizing their education at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Miller, five students have been assisted by the program already and that number is expected to rise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is a joint partnership between Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Services, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and the Financial Crisis Response Team, according to Mike Miller, assistant vice chancellor for Enrollment Services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding comes from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program works to estimate and assess the needs of students. It also serves to identify students who might be experiencing more systematic financial difficulties so as to direct them to resources that can provide them assistance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is an effort to help address the growing basic need requests we have been seeing here on our campus, which unfortunately is a national trend due to the increasing cost of higher education,” Miller said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A process will be in place to notify landlords that a student is working with the housing voucher program, said Miller. Communication between landlords and the program is key to buying the student time to receive funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hopeful our relationships in those areas will be fruitful in buying us the time needed to sort through these issues which can sometimes be complicated,” Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources from UCHS will be utilized in the program, such as UCHS mediators that are in place to settle disputes between tenants and landlords.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each case is carefully addressed and verified through the Financial Crisis Response Team to prevent misuse of the vouchers, Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vouchers are also either directed into the student’s BARC account or addressed as checks to their landlord, Muñoz said. No cases of misuse have been reported yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The housing voucher program is the first step in creating a safety net program for students struggling financially, Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we make programs like this, I want to make sure they’re sustainable long-term, so we’re not just offering a service for a couple of years, then seeing it go away,” Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really need to see what kind of volume we’re going to see and go from there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can submit an application to the Financial Crisis Response Team by emailing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financialcrisis@sa.ucsb.edu</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Hall, named after its donors Jeff and Judy Henley, will be the new headquarters for the Institute for Energy Efficiency (IEE). It will serve as home to a lecture hall, 17 labs, faculty and administrative offices and a three-story open-air atrium.</p>\n<p>The IEE focuses on the creation of new technologies and methods of energy conservation and sustainability, according to the UCSB Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises website.</p>\n<p>Henley will be the largest hall at UCSB to date with an estimated at 49,000 gross square feet. It is now in the initial stages of development.</p>\n<p>It will be designed to reduce its water and energy usage, along with its emissions.</p>\n<p>“[Henley Hall] is an outgrowth of our high-priority need for lab and teaching space, and also a recognition of UC Santa Barbara’s leadership in cutting-edge research on energy efficiency,” Leslie Colasse, project manager for Henley Hall, said.</p>\n<p>Henley is designed to maximize space and minimize the carbon footprint the building creates, according to the UCSB Design, Facilities and Safety Services website.</p>\n<p>The building will be composed of mostly steel and concrete with terracotta roof paneling and spires to promote natural shade and cooling.</p>\n<p>Henley is entirely donor funded, with a $56 million budget provided by the Henleys and various other anonymous donors.</p>\n<p>The idea for the new hall came about due to growing class size, restrictive lecture hall capacity and the Institute’s growing impact on the UCSB campus, according to Associated Students (A.S.) President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>“I think it is pretty apparent on campus that there is a shortage of classroom space. The amount of resources UCSB is given, there is still students sitting on the floor… Students [are] taking midterms on floors and that just entirely unacceptable,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>News of Henley first reached the A.S. Main Office after complaints came in about blocked off bike paths around Campbell Hall, she added.</p>\n<p>Henley Hall and the IEE will be the Henleys’s largest gift to UCSB.
