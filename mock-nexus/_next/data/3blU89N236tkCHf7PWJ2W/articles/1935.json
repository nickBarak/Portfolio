id=\"caption-attachment-90840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long associated with the hippie and counterculture movements, the widespread availability of psychedelics and other substances in the 1960s attracted the concern of governments worldwide, leading to the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970 and the further stigmatization of psychedelics in American culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ever since psychedelics were criminalized by Nixon around the early ‘70s, it’s been hard to use them in research or therapy,” Emily Gworek, fourth-year biopsychology major and cofounder of UCSB’s Psychedelic Club, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is changing — the conversation and culture around psychedelics is beginning to shift, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past couple of decades … people have been pushing those bureaucratic boundaries and working the drugs through clinical trials,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded by UCSB students Gworek, Surya Santhanam and Kristel Kerrigan, Psychedelic Club of UCSB aims to provide a space on campus to facilitate honest discussions about psychedelics.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first branch of Psychedelic Club was established at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2014. Psychedelic Club’s overarching mission is to “increase mainstream cultural awareness and acceptance of psychedelics,” according to a statement from its </span><a href=\"https://www.psychedeliclub.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On the very basic level, we want to be a safe space for people to come and talk about whatever interest they have in it. Bad or positive experiences, life-changing experiences. We want them to be able to connect with people about [psychedelics] and learn,” Kerrigan, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of us are biopsychology majors; we know how [psychedelics] work on your brain and how it affects your body. We want to actually inform people on that and actually talk about research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychedelic Club of UCSB is the first branch of Psychedelic Club in California and the 10th in the nation, with other branches located in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maine, according to its website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek first became aware of Psychedelic Club while browsing research on the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (M.A.P.S.) website, stumbling upon a link to the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then reached out to Clayton Ickes, the vice president of Psychedelic Club at CU Boulder, and began discussions to establish a branch of Psychedelic Club at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Gworek was starting to have conversations with other UCSB students surrounding their shared interest in psychedelics research. Over the summer, Gworek communicated with Santhanam over text, although they didn’t meet in person until the beginning of this school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were intrigued by historical research into psychedelics, as well as the growing acceptance of psychedelics in present-day psychological research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] see all this valid research — although most of it was done in the ‘60s before the giant ban on drugs,” Santhanam, a third-year psychological and brain sciences major, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were these incredible findings with people with terminal illnesses. Psychedelics had this capacity to help people accept death or change their attitudes toward death, which I think is phenomenal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research also indicated that psychedelics were effective in managing disorders like anxiety and depression and even had a degree of effectiveness when other medications weren’t working, according to Santhanam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only recently have institutions began to address the subject of psychedelics on a large scale, Gworek said. In September, Johns Hopkins University opened a center for psychedelic research: The Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. Funded with $17 million from private donors, it is the first research institution of its kind in the United States and the largest of its kind in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“John Hopkins has opened their research center for psychedelics, which is amazing. I would love to be a part of that and get more labs open to that, although definitely something that needs to happen now is that [psychedelics research] needs to be more structured and have more direction,” Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santhanam, Gworek and Kerrigan were also interested in how the everyday person could benefit from psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics can allow even your average person to get new perspectives on life and it allows people to be really introspective and remind you how important it is to be present and intentional with the things that you do,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a psychedelic is metabolizing the serotonin receptor, it seems to fire much faster and also can make parts of your brain interact that don’t normally communicate,” Santhanam added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Santhanam, psychedelics allow one to reexamine aspects of their life in manners which are difficult to perform without psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek, Santhanam and Kerrigan intend to use the club as a platform to inform people of the benefits and drawbacks to using psychedelics, as well as dispel common misconceptions regarding psychedelics and how they compare to other drugs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics are not the go-to drugs for most people. You’d be surprised by how many people may have heard about it but don’t even know what a psychedelic is,” Santhanam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the near future, Psychedelic Club would like to bring speakers and advocacy organizations to campus, such as EntheoMedicine, as well as host risk management events in the style of The Zendo Project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EntheoMedicine people are the people that kind of guide you through your trip and they host events in other countries where it’s legal, and they’re kind of guides when you’re on it. They said they’d be interested, and that they really want to talk to young people, Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zendo Project is a program associated with M.A.P.S., which provides psychedelic harm reduction to those at festivals, concerts and other events where psychedelic substances may be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re at a festival and you’re using psychedelics and things get weird and you’re uncomfortable and you’re anxious and you’re overwhelmed because you’re surrounded by thousands of people and pounding music, they provide a safe space where you can go,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have therapists who are trained to deal with people having a difficult psychedelic experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek plans to host a psychedelic harm reduction event in the same vein to teach people about risk management, how to best navigate bad trips and, beyond that, what to learn from difficult trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If something goes wrong like that, that’s an anxiety that a lot of people have about using psychedelics. It’d be nice to educate people on how to best handle those kinds of situations,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But above all else, the priority of Psychedelic Club is to start the conversation about psychedelic use. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping the club will just be a place where people who are interested in psychedelics or psychedelic research or just the psychedelic experience in general … can just kind of congregate and have those discussions,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Both Santa Barbara natives, the two Hauschild’s were used to playing with each other on the same teams in both the High School level at San Marcos and at the club level while also attending matches at UCSB’s Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The two brothers were introduced to the sport by their younger sister who had been playing since she was 10. She is now currently a freshman at USC and is a member of the Trojans’ women’s water polo team as a driver after graduating from San Marcos High.</p>\n<p>Once introduced, Shane and Ben loved the sport and before you knew it, the Hauschild family had another connection point: water polo.</p>\n<p>“We went to try it, immediately loved it and made it our top priority so it really united all of us because we all had our different paths but water polo connected us. It definitely been a huge positive,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>“She [the sister] definitely started the water polo trend in the family and then my parents caught on, became the biggest supporters and we all then grew to love the sport immensely uniting us even more,” Ben added.</p>\n<p>With Shane being a year older, he was the first of the two to get the opportunity to go to University and continue his water polo career. In that 2014 season, Shane won the MPSF Freshman of Year after a 32-goal season while Ben led his high school team to its first league title in 20 years.</p>\n<p>What Shane accomplished his freshman year was remarkable, however, just the fact he was able to continue his water polo career at a Division-I NCAA level was incredible on its own when you consider only 2.8 percent of US High School Water Polo Players compete at NCAA I schools.</p>\n<p>Now after looking at that, it’s even more incredible to consider that the younger Hauschild was also able to get his own Division-I opportunity, opting to go to San Jose State, a school that is new to the water polo scene.</p>\n<p>“I heard it’s going to grow quickly and I could’ve gone to a more established program and do something that’s already happened,” Ben said. “Or I had this unique opportunity to come to San Jose State and work with a program, build a program and be a big name on a growing program.”</p>\n<p>After the decision was made, an even more amazing coincidence happened. UCSB, along with a few other programs, seceded from the MPSF, their former conference, and established the GCC, a conference that added San Jose State along for the ride.</p>\n<p>The move, unknowingly, set the stage not just for this Friday’s match, but last years match.</p>\n<p>Nearly one year ago to the day, the two brothers faced off for the first time ever at Campus Pool and to this day remember the feelings of that night.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous because quite honestly I didn’t know what to expect, I never had to guard him before that,” Shane said. “I didn’t know how physical it would get and I didn’t know how to go about it at all but it all went well in the end.”</p>\n<p>“It was the most anticipated match for me all season long,” Ben said. “I definitely tried to take it to another level. I didn’t want to get bested by him so there was definitely some extra adrenaline playing each other.”</p>\n<p>Not just happy that they got to play each other, Ben and Shane were also excited to be able to play in Santa Barbara, the place they grew up and the place that held all their friends and family.</p>\n<p>After the match, UCSB, a heavy favorite, came out the victor 13-7 to no one’s shock, but the brothers never shared a moment of displeasure with each other.</p>\n<p>“Even though we are supposed to be rivals I know he is still my brother. It’s more of a fun rivalry as compared to an actual competitive rivalry. We both want the best for each other,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Even though Ben and his team came out the loser, he was never unappreciative of the fact he got to go toe-to-toe with his big brother.</p>\n<p>“I feel gratitude playing against him. I don’t feel the need to outperform him, I don’t want him to play bad or anything like that,” Ben said. “I am just trying to put on a good show and performance for my team and I know he’s going to do the same.”</p>\n<p>Like brother, like brother both Shane and Ben say playing in that Oct. 14 conference game last year at Campus Pool has been the favorite moment of their collegiate careers with both even pointing to the end of the match specifically.</p>\n<p>“Best moment was by far end of the game last year at UCSB,” Ben said. “Knowing I did my absolute best and kind of my coming out party because since then I have played my game but just playing in front of that crowd, in that pool and playing in a place I saw games at growing up was amazing.”</p>\n<p>“My favorite moment was after the game last year because we just gave each other a big hug after the match and just talked,” Shane said. “Everyone of our friends and family came up super stoked and we all reflected on the game and it was super cool.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Friday’s match, which could be the last time the two ever play each other again with Shane being a senior unless they meet at the conference tournament, both brothers are looking for the win, but even more than that, both are looking to cherish what could be the end of a fun era.</p>\n<p>“I definitely want to make the most of this game,” Ben said. “With this being the last time we could play each other I am going to go all out, hope for a good result and I think it will be a good game between us.”</p>\n<p>“This could be the last time I play him and this could be the last year I even play water polo in general so I just want to have fun and cherish being at that moment playing with and against my brother,” Shane said.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ben is not particularly shy about making his goal known of hopefully being able to pull off the upset this Friday. In fact, it would be his version of a perfect ending to this brotherly trilogy.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would definitely be beating UCSB which had been a huge motivation for me since coming here, I couldn’t ask for anything more than to score an upset over UCSB while he [Shane] is still around,” Ben said.</p>\n<p>Getting more specific, Ben added he would like a “close one-goal game in overtime with SJSU coming out the victor with me scoring the final goal over my brother and against one of my closest friends [Justyn Barrios, UCSB’s goalkeeper] to seal the win.”</p>\n<p>On the other side, Shane has never been one to tease his brother over the fact his team has gotten the better of him twice in this rivalry but he also recognizes, winning is better than losing.</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to lie, I would be upset if we lost,” Shane laughed. “Not at him obviously but more so at myself and our team. He would probably rub it in to make me mad but it would also be a good memory. I would definitely want to get my revenge at that tournament at that point.”</p>\n<p>With that, Shane’s perfect ending to this trifecta would be as follows.</p>\n<p>“Perfect ending would be us coming out with a win but my brother comes out happy after a great game, then after the game, we hug it out, go get dinner with our parents and be happy.”</p>\n<p>No matter the outcome, no matter the whose version of a perfect ending comes true, no matter anything, the two brothers have made it clear that this game means more than just the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>The two have been connected for a long time thanks to water polo, and it’s because of water polo that they get this special platform to go head-to-head one more time.</p>\n<p>Cherishing the moment is more important for them than ever holding ill-will toward one another for something as simple as winning and losing.</p>\n<p>Because as far as this writer is concerned, both Ben and Shane Hauschild have already won at something much more important: happiness. A word that perfectly encapsulates the feelings this two share when they are in the pool whether it be with each other or against one another.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

However, the office does keep copies of the allegations on file, even if the student isn’t punished following a first infraction, according to the warning emails sent to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never tried to get an ID in the past, but I’m on Free and For Sale and I see the posts all the time and I know it’s a common thing people do,” said a fourth-year anthropology major, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The student posted on the Free and For Sale page looking for an extra ID so their younger sister, who is not a UCSB student, could attend Delirium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting on the Facebook page, a warning email from the Office of Student Conduct appeared in the student’s inbox. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t even think about it being an issue because everyone’s been doing it for so long. It’s something that I see around this time of year every single year, for all the concerts,” the student added. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB does not go through the Free &amp; For Sale page looking for offenders, according to Armistead. Instead, she said the university receives reports and screenshots of student ID sales from other individuals, often students, who use the page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people who run the Facebook group used to take down and report posts about ID sales, but due to the sheer volume of posts, they are simply unable to keep up with all of them, according to the page’s administrator, Dayllan Maar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the university really cares that much about it, they’re more than welcome to look through the page and find everyone who’s violating the rules,” Maar said. “If the university doesn’t view it to be that important of a rule, I don’t know why I should enforce a rule the university doesn’t want to enforce.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University administrators, police officers and members of Associated Students are all members of the Facebook page, meaning that they can see when students make posts about ID sales, according to Maar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maar said he suspects UCSB is cracking down on the posts now due to the page’s growing user base, which had 20,000 members when he became a moderator in 2017, but has doubled to over 40,000 members in the last two years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead’s assertion that the presence of non-students at student-only events opens the door to safety concerns was backed up by Student Advocate General Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is most dangerous is when people outside of Isla Vista and the UCSB community come to Isla Vista and UCSB and they pose a potential danger to our community because they’re not from this community,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have no stake in this community, there’s no personal ties. That’s where a lot of reckless behavior happens.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen, whose office assists alleged violators of student conduct policy, added that when students rent their IDs to non-students, they might be held responsible for the behavior of whoever used their ID. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of official security concerns, some students are frustrated with the current policy on who is allowed to attend the concerts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do understand the concept of doing a UCSB-only concert, but I think if a student doesn’t want to go … if that person wasn’t going to go anyway, then you might as well let someone else go,” the fourth-year added. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90784\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/looking-to-sell-your-id-card-expect-a-warning-from-the-university/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90784\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/looking-to-sell-your-id-card-expect-a-warning-from-the-university/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/looking-to-sell-your-id-card-expect-a-warning-from-the-university/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/looking-to-sell-your-id-card-expect-a-warning-from-the-university/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-30/looking-to-sell-your-id-card-expect-a-warning-from-the-university/","id":1932,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1931,1930,1929],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
