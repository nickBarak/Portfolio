Clinic Building. The meeting will run from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., and lunch will be provided. Stakeholders involved in I.V. — heads of local nonprofit organizations, volunteers, long-term residents, students, county representatives and Isla Vista Foot Patrol officers — will update one another on the status of their respective groups as they relate to the community. I.V. Community Network meetings are regularly held on the second Thursday of every month.</p>\n<p><strong>DESSERT DAY</strong><br>\nFor those wondering where you can get your hamantaschen fix, look no further than Friendship Manor. Hamantaschen is a triangular cookie or pastry filled with nearly anything, from jellies to cheese to Nutella. This treat is traditionally associated with the Jewish holiday of Purim. The Santa Barbara Hillel invites community members to the Hillel to make hamantaschen with the elderly living at Friendship Manor on Thursday from 2-3:30 p.m. Those interested are urged to RSVP on the Santa Barbara Hillel Facebook page and will receive community service hours.</p>\n<p><strong>NEW COLORS</strong><br>\nUCSB students in the Urban Arts Workshop will unveil a mural from 3:30-5 p.m. Thursday at 6696 Del Playa Drive. The student painters have worked on the mural under artist Gabriel Cardenas since Fall Quarter and will be discussing the process of creating the mural, as well as the impacts murals have in the Isla Vista community. Local businesses will provide food and drinks, and all community members are welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>’ZINE SCENE</strong><br>\n<em>The Catalyst</em> literary magazine will host its quarterly launch party at 6 p.m. on Thursday at Coffee Collaborative. Organizers will be handing out free copies of the magazine’s 10th issue, which includes the prose, poetry and art submissions of UCSB students. Authors will be reading aloud their poetry alongside performances from spoken word artists and local band The Real Savage Henry.</p>\n<p><strong>MEMORIAL GARDEN</strong><br>\nIVRPD is having a volunteer work day starting at 2 p.m. Friday for upkeep at the Isla Vista Love and Remembrance Garden at People’s Park. The memorial garden was created to celebrate the lives of those lost in the May 23, 2014 shooting. Tools are supplied, but IVRPD officials ask that volunteers bring their own gloves. Pizza will also be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>MEATLESS SUNDAY</strong><br>\nA local organization called Food Not Bombs will serve free vegan food at 5 p.m. Sunday in Little Acorn Park (next to Bagel Cafe). Those interested in cooking can email organizers at foodnotbombsislavista@gmail.com. The dinner is regularly held every Sunday.</p>\n<p><strong>DEAD WEEK DIY</strong><br>\nA.S. Program Board understands the necessity of coffee as Dead Week rolls around. The organization will be hosting a mug decorating do-it-yourself session from 6:30-8:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Pardall Center. The event will include free snacks, scantrons and mugs. Pro tip: you can study at the same time if you try painting your mug with elements from the periodic table or key terms from your study guide.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76337\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/vista-point-local-freebies-and-activities-this-week/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76337\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/vista-point-local-freebies-and-activities-this-week/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/vista-point-local-freebies-and-activities-this-week/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/vista-point-local-freebies-and-activities-this-week/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/vista-point-local-freebies-and-activities-this-week/","id":2417,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2416,2415,2414],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report","biography":"Not available","articles":[1981,1982,2072,2234,2284,2351,2370,2417,2437,2512,2534,2614,2711,2733,2738,2754,2801,2827,2835,2940,2984,2992,3004,3036,3044,3090,3438,3439,3444,3450,3453,3465,3470,3471,3520,3581,3628,3655,3679,3698,3764,3776,3789,3791,3792,3794,3797,3800,3907,3958,3970,4043,4061,4134,4135,4169,4189,4190,4196,4197,4199,4213,4215,4216,4230,4232,4236,4244,4249,4250,4253,4262,4271,4277,4279,4281,4293,4294,4296,4309,4314,4315,4325,4328,4330,4343,4345,4346,4354,4364,4373,4374,4400,4405,4411,4412,4424,4425,4427,4429,4439,4446,4460,4461,4463,4468,4485,4486,4580,4635,4638,4640,4644,4702,4707,4728,4761,4777,4814,8046],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Loses ‘Goofy, Caring’ Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-12.21.10-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-12.21.10-PM.png?resize=863%2C622&ssl=1","description":"A UC Santa Barbara global studies major died in his sleep on Feb. 15 in his Santa Barbara home.

She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.</p>\n<p>“He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,” she said. “So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.</p>\n<p>“After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,” she said.</p>\n<p>Michelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.</p>\n<p>“He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,” Lew said. “Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.”</p>\n<p>Lew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.</p>\n<p>“He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>Lew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.</p>\n<p>“The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,” Lew said. “The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’”</p>\n<p>Lew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.</p>\n<p>“Everything just fit together by random chance,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>In high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.</p>\n<p>Wyatt described Anthony Tsang as “curious and mischievous … but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.”</p>\n<p>“It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.</p>\n<p>“It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,” Wyatt said. “And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.” It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.”</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as “someone you could count on, no matter what it was.”</p>\n<p>“I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in … he wasn’t really one to judge people,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a “huge impact” on his own high school experience.</p>\n<p>“He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,” Wyatt said. “It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he “really loved it.”</p>\n<p>He traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how “nice” and “chill” everyone was there.</p>\n<p>According to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a “big beer enthusiast,” which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.</p>\n<p>“He liked … just how everyone is so easygoing,” Lew said. “He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Lew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.</p>\n<p>Anthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.</p>\n<p>“A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,” Lew said. “We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.</p>\n<p>“He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,” Tiana Tsang said. “And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76129\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76129\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/ucsb-loses-goofy-caring-student/","id":2414,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2413,2412,2411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"George Thurlow Joins CSD on First Day of Business","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CSD-First-Day-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&ssl=1","description":"The CSD held its first public meeting on Tuesday in which the Board elected officers, established three new committees and addressed an open forum of community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Decades of self-governance movements culminated in a six-hour gathering at the Isla Vista Community Room this Tuesday evening when the I.V.

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in March that 124 UC staff and faculty members were accused of violating Title IX between January 2013 and April 2016. Of the six UCSB staff and faculty accused, all investigations were conducted under old Title IX policy from 2013, according to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UC sexual harassment policy underwent its latest change in January 2016, after UC President Janet Napolitano organized the Task Force in 2014 on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault. The Task Force was comprised of committees dedicated to revising multiple aspects of the policy.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal state law ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate in federally funded educational programs without discrimination based on sex. The law can apply to cases of sexual misconduct and assault and any university-affiliated organization, including sports groups and admissions.</p>\n<p>Of the six UCSB investigations, one faculty member received a salary reduction, and the university required another to attend sexual harassment training and personal counseling. Two cases ended with the termination of an employee.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the Title IX office substantiated the claims, but the university took no further disciplinary action as far as documents show.</p>\n<p>Estrada said in an email that it is “too speculative” to conclude if these case investigations would have resulted differently under the 2016 policy revisions.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Salvaty, the UC Title IX coordinator, also said she could not know if an outcome of a case would have been different under the revised policy, but she said the new policy changes would improve Title IX for future cases.</p>\n<p>“I can say that the current policy, and the recommended changes the campuses are implementing, have strengthened the University’s processes and procedures,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76141\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76141\" data-attachment-id=\"76141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/title-ix-graphic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=898%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"title ix graphic 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=888%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76141\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=888%2C421\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Adjustments made to the policy did, however, alter the way the UC investigates student and employee cases.</p>\n<p>According to Salvaty, under the new policy, Title IX officers review student-on-student sexual violence claims under the same procedures across all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Employee-related cases also underwent “important provisions,” including the requirements that investigations must be concluded within 60 days, both the complainant and the respondent must be notified of the investigation’s outcome and the complainant must be informed of the repercussions imposed on the respondent.</p>\n<p>“Those are some big changes that come to mind,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>While Salvaty could not speak about specific cases, she said cases reviewed under the older policy could not be reconsidered a second time, even though policies have changed.</p>\n<p>“I assume that if a matter was investigated and adjudicated under a then existing process, it could not be investigated again under a new process,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>Salvaty said, however, that consequences for violators may differ depending on each university because decisions on penalties are decided upon by the supervisors of each case at the university, not the Title IX officers and investigators.</p>\n<p>This can result in varied forms of punishment for UC staff and faculty members.</p>\n<p>The UCOP Task Force recommended that each UC campus increase sexual harassment and assault training amongst staff and faculty and create a Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) Advocate on each campus to help survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment, which UCSB has instated. They also recommend the development of a campus Peer Review Committee to review final investigation reports and advise the chancellor on disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>The UC campuses are currently in the process of implementing all the Task Force’s recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/","id":2415,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2414,2413,2412],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
