Day in and day out, athletes at every level sacrifice their time, their bodies and their blood, sweat and tears in the name of something bigger.</p>\n<p>After all their hard work and determination, it’s safe to say that most of these athletes would do anything not to jeopardize their chances of making it big. Sometimes though, as was the case for midfielder Andy Perez of the UCSB men’s soccer team, things don’t always go according to plan.</p>\n<p>Coming into the 2014 season, Perez was one of a large handful of underclassmen on a very young Gaucho team that still had much to prove. After a relatively quiet freshman year in which he appeared in just nine games, the Los Altos native had some uncertainty in terms of his role coming into his sophomore season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After not seeing the field about a month into the season, Perez openly voiced his concerns to Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always aspired to be a starter or a strong contributor off the bench and this year I was a little worried that maybe my game wasn’t as developed as it needed to be,” Perez said. “I went to Tim and I told him that I think we should really discuss the opportunity of me redshirting.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg agreed to Perez’s proposition, using stellar senior teammate and starting right back Kevin Garcia-Lopez, who redshirted his freshman year, as an example of how the situation could potentially benefit not only him, but the team as well.</p>\n<p>However, after Perez sat out for the first 14 games of the season with no intention of playing, the circumstances surrounding the team changed. The Gauchos had been torn apart by injuries and suspensions, resulting in a mid-season slump in which they went 0-3-1 in four-straight road games, jeopardizing their chances of even qualifying for the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Then, after junior midfielder Adam Carn-Saferstein tore his MCL in practice, Vom Steeg had to make a radical decision.</p>\n<p>“We literally ran out of midfielders,” Vom Steeg said. “I called Andy into the office after practice and I said, ‘I need you to play. We’ve got five games left and I need you to start on Wednesday.’”</p>\n<p>For Perez to give up his redshirt season with just five games remaining, he would be giving up an entire year of eligibility, potentially hurting his lifelong dream of making it to the pros. The shocking request was not easy for him to hear and after telling his coach that he would think about it, he turned to friends and family for support. His father, being a former member of the San Jose Earthquakes, gave him perhaps the most important advice of all.</p>\n<p>“My dad actually played professional soccer, so he has a little more insight,” Perez said. “He told me that although it does put me in a very difficult situation, Tim is my coach. He’s the one who brought me to this school and if he needs me, then I’ve got to do what my coach says.”</p>\n<p>Finally, a conflicted Perez turned to Vom Steeg, sending him a text message asking for guidance prior to making his final decision.</p>\n<p>“His response was very, very positive, telling me that he felt like I could be the spark to help us win some games,” Perez said. “After I read that text I was just like, ‘Okay, if you believe in me then I’ll do whatever I can to help the team out.’”</p>\n<p>Perez made his first start in UCSB’s next game against Sacramento State. In a must-win situation, he felt more pressure than normal as he stepped into the Gauchos’ depleted midfield.</p>\n<p>“The whole day before, I was a little nervous because I felt like there was a lot of pressure on me to come in and make a difference early,” Perez said. “Literally, the first 15 minutes of the game I wasn’t thinking about anything else but scoring.”</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long before what seemed like a scripted story began taking place. In just the 17th minute, sophomore left-winger Ismaila Jome sent in a low cross towards the six-yard box that somehow reached Perez. Fighting off a defender, he got just enough of a touch to roll the ball just past the keeper and inside the left post, giving him his first career NCAA goal.</p>\n<p>“That felt like a perfect moment for me, because I had been thinking about it the whole day before and I had doubts about whether I had made the right decision or not,” Perez said. “Right when I scored that goal, I knew that I made the right decision and I haven’t thought about it twice since then. It was probably one of the coolest moments of my life.”</p>\n<p>Since rejoining the team, Perez has started every game and the Gauchos have gone an undefeated 3-0-1. Their recent run of good form has earned them a first-round bye in the Big West Tournament and home-field advantage throughout.</p>\n<p>While Perez is not the only reason that UCSB has performed so well under pressure this year, he certainly has provided the spark that Vom Steeg saw in him.

Head Coach Angela Kelly and her Longhorns finished the 2014 season with an 11-8-4 record, good enough to clinch the fifth seed in conference play. The Longhorns are a confident team on the road claiming a record of 6-2 last season so expect them to play with poise and not be phased by the Gaucho Locos.</p>\n<p>Notables for Texas include 5-10 sophomore Olivia Brook. As a freshman, Brooke led the team in scoring with 16 points, seven goals and 18 shots on goal. Brooke proved to be the offensive target for Texas, registering a game-winning goal against archrival No. 21 Texas Tech for an upset win in overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior mid Lindsey Meyer will also be a player that UCSB must defend well against. Meyer finished second overall on the team in scoring with 12 points and five goals. Like Brooke, Meyer is not afraid of the big moment, seizing two game-winners during her junior campaign including one in the Big-12 Quarterfinal against Texas Tech.</p>\n<p>Defending that Longhorn frontline and containing the play of duo Brook and Meyer will be a crucial factor in UCSB’s success on Friday.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos’ key to success their strategy is simple: continue to attack the frontline as they did in their match against San Jose State.</p>\n<p>Coach Stumpf found that his forwards are at their best when they act as the aggressor and must use their athleticism to their advantage against the Longhorns’ backline.</p>\n<p>“The challenge that our frontline faces is to maintain possession so we can have numbers and pick and choose their moments to take a risk for a scoring opportunity,” Stumpf said. “We need to do a better job keeping the ball when it’s required and deciding when to drop a shoulder to beat someone 1-v-1.”</p>\n<p>On top of their big match against Texas on Friday, the Gauchos host another non-conference opponent this Sunday in Sacramento State. The Hornets are currently 0-3 on the year including a 2-1 loss to San Jose State last Sunday.</p>\n<p>Look for junior midfielder Maggie Pleis to be a focal point for Sac State. Pleis leads the team this season with one goal and three shots on goal. Pleis earned the honor of All Big-Sky Second Team as a sophomore and racked up 22 shots with 10 shots on goal for the Hornets last season.</p>\n<p>Heading into this weekend, Stumpf emphasized that his team must be very mindful and take care of themselves.</p>\n<p>“Friday night is going to be very physically demanding on us. No matter what happens, we will have to put that behind us and do everything we can physically and mentally to be ready for Sacramento.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos kickoff their match with Texas tomorrow at 7 p.m. and Sac State on Sunday at 1 p.m at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

soccer team heads on its first road trip of the season to Albuquerque this weekend for games against Denver and New Mexico.</p>\n<p>“Our expectation is that we finish the weekend without giving up any goals,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think what we’re looking to do more than anything is getting our offense on track. That’s what I’m anxious to see this weekend.”</p>\n<p>With just one game under their belt, the Gauchos jumped up to a No. 19 national ranking based on the NSCAA Coaches poll earlier this week. Last Friday’s win made it five straight season-opening victories for UCSB, putting its record at 10-1 over the last 11 years.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Junior forward Nick DePuy comes in as the Gauchos’ lone scorer, having put away the deciding goal in the 1-0 win over Stanford. Dating back to last year, the former midfielder has been on an incredible hot streak, scoring in six of his last seven games with eight total goals during that span.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re way too good offensively to not be able to dominate these two games, create goalscoring chances and maybe put two, three, four goals away,” Vom Steeg said. “At some point this year we’re going to be a team that other teams are really going to fear because we can come at you in a lot of different ways.”</p>\n<p>Last Friday’s game also welcomed defender Sam Strong to the lineup for the first time. The composed freshman gave an outstanding debut performance, shutting down a high-profile athlete in Stanford’s junior forward Jordan Morris, resulting in his being named the Big West Defensive Player of the Week. <em>College Soccer News</em> also named Strong to the National Team of the Week.</p>\n<p>“Sam and [sophomore defender Jeff] Quezada had a good game, our whole backline did, but we’re going to have to do it again,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re playing a New Mexico team that is going to be one of the better teams in the country. We have our work cut out for us, but Sam and Quezada played together all spring so they do have the chemistry, and I think there’s no reason why we can’t expect to shut people down again.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, they will be without starting goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg. The superb freshman received a call up to the US Under-20 National Team roster to play in the Stevan Vilotic-Cele Tournament in Serbia this weekend after a solid performance of his own against last Friday.</p>\n<p>In Vom Steeg’s absence, sophomore goalkeeper Brandon Berke, who started and played well for much of last season, will get the start.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a fortunate situation where Brandon was in our goal last year for three quarters of the season,” Vom Steeg said. “It is an adjustment, you do lose a little bit of height with Brandon but at the same time he’s athletic, he’s quick, he gets to balls, he’s a hard-working goalkeeper and he has the confidence of the team.”</p>\n<p>With new Head Coach Jamie Franks leading the way, Denver has gotten off to a fantastic start to its 2015 campaign. The Pioneers have started 2-0-0, including a 4-0 win over CSU Bakersfield in their season opener. Taking into account their two exhibition games last month, they have gone a perfect 4-4 on shutouts this year.</p>\n<p>“I always feel like when any program has a new coach their players really listen and they’re all trying to prove themselves,” Vom Steeg said. “I always find that those are tough teams to play because you have a team that’s got a lot of energy and a lot of life.”</p>\n<p>New Mexico has played just one game this season, losing 1-0 to UCLA last Saturday. When the Lobos last hosted UCSB in 2013, they shut down the Gauchos on their way to a 1-0 win.</p>\n<p>“New Mexico is a lot like us in that they will have a very large crowd<strong>. </strong>They are a team that’s usually built for their field, and it’s just one of the harder places to play,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s going to be a test for us and it’s a game where you really start to find out a lot about your team, especially when you’re on the road.”</p>\n<p>Playing on the road has caused problems for UCSB in the past, as it won just three of nine games away from Harder Stadium last year, and New Mexico’s impactful crowd support could make it a difficult environment to play in. However, with a more experienced roster that won its last two crucial road games to close out the season in 2014, the Gauchos should perform well in their first road test.</p>\n<p>“This is one of the areas where we just have to do better,” Vom Steeg said. “If we can find a result, that’s something that we can continue to build on. We have four consecutive road games and we’re going to know a lot more about the kind of team and the kind of season we’re going to have.”</p>\n<p>UCSB plays Denver at 3:00 p.m. PDT on Friday and New Mexico at 5:00 p.m. PDT on Sunday at CIBER Field in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

team’s disappointing 4-1 loss to archrival Cal Poly on the road, the UCSB men’s soccer team saw one positive come out of last weekend and that was the 3-0 loss that third place Sac State experienced to UC Davis; meaning that the second place seed was no longer up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, UCSB’s 15 total points in the standings have the team at 2<sup>nd</sup> overall on the Big West league table and the Big West North. The winner of the Big West South, Cal State Fullerton, only finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the Gauchos’ regular season campaign featured a conference record of 4-3-3. The team proved to be inconsistent at times whether it is at home or on the road, but dominant enough to net them yet another playoff berth. Overall, the Gauchos finished 6-7-5.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Concerning statistic, the team only totaled 13 goals across nine matches, yet held opposing sides to 17 scores against them. However, as much as this speaks volumes for both the offensive and defensive sides for the Gauchos, the team still can cherish a combined 3 clean sheets on the year to go with their quarterfinalist position.</p>\n<p>When reflecting back at previous analysis to commence the season; not many would’ve figured UC Davis to have topped not only their division but also the entire Big West board.</p>\n<p>This is due in part because of their early first-round exit in last year’s playoff. Nonetheless, the Aggies appear to be the team to beat and the Gauchos have yet to beat them even after two encounters this season. In fact, UCSB was outscored in those two contests 8-0.</p>\n<p>Now, UCSB will look ahead to their first-round opponents as they draw UC Riverside at home to kick off the postseason. The Highlanders finished their collegiate season with an overall record of 4-12-1 and 4-5-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>One of those five conference losses came in an out of division matchup, on the road, against UCSB. The result was ultimately a 3-1 victory for the Gauchos, but thanks to the whopping 10 total saves from UC Riverside’s goalkeeper Vincent Morales, the score didn’t run up anymore.</p>\n<p>Besides a very talented goalie, the Highlanders also boast a fairly prolific goal scorer in junior forward Antonio Lokossou.</p>\n<p>He currently leads his team in the goals category with a total 5 tallies and also maintains the most shots at goal with 26 on the season. Paired with the team assist team leader of sophomore forward Anthony Lopez who has three helpers and two goals to his name, the Gauchos would be wise to game plan with these two in mind.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Rodney Michael once again stepped up for his time and netted the redemption score in their previous 4-1 loss. On the year, Michael continues to lead his team in both categories with eight goals and three assists (tied with Ignacio Tellechea).</p>\n<p>Easily claiming the team’s regular season MVP consideration, his success also extends to a league level as he is tied for second most Big West goals scored and third most shots taken.</p>\n<p>Michael also earned Big West Freshman of the Year and Big West All-First Team Honors.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Alan Carrillo will also be a big key to the Gauchos postseason success if they enjoy any. The La Mirada native has allowed nine of his 24 goals allowed in the last three games.</p>\n<p>His 1.27 goals against average still rank fourth in the Big West, and his 50 total saves rank sixth, however, he must play better if he hopes to lead the Gauchos to the semifinals.</p>\n<p>He, alongside Michael, was named to the Big West All-Freshman Team while senior defender Randy Mendoza was named to the All-Big West Second Team.</p>\n<p>With a hopefully continued success through the postseason, and if the Gauchos could relocate their once solid defensive line, then UCSB can very well consider a deep run in the Big West playoff race.</p>\n<p>From here on out it’s simple, single elimination games and Wednesday’s victors will land themselves a ticket to Saturday’s semifinal games; thus propelling them that much closer to the following week’s Big West Finals and that coveted championship title.</p>\n<p>Big West early round championship locations still remain on campus sites, so the Gauchos will be hosting UC Riverside this Wednesday, November 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79468\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79468\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/","id":1512,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1511,1510,1509],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
