In my time here I’ve seen surf both mind-blowing and mundane, but unfortunately most of what I’ve seen around campus has always leaned towards the piddly mush. Perhaps that’s because my first fall quarter surfing Campus Point was so epic that it almost ruined my next two years surfing UCSB.</p>\n<p>Picture this: I’m a freshie, chillin’ in the Anacapa dorm. All of a sudden, I wake up in early December and guess what? It’s macking out there! So I charge it. I surfed the point until I was fatigued beyond exhausted and managed to bag my first Kelly Slater sighting. I had been surfing all day, the waves were probably head and a half, maybe double overhead, and just almost perfect. It was near dusk when I saw Slater and it was just me, Slater and another dude out in the water — way beyond the inside breakers, waiting for the outside set. After a short wait a big set comes in and Slater is in the deepest spot; but if I were him I would have never tried to take-off from where he was sitting—it was just a really heavy, slabby wave that was already closing out. But he’s Slater. And he charged it, throwing himself and his board over the lip, air-dropping maybe three or four feet, dropping down, down, down. Then he fell.</p>\n<p>That, my friends, was perhaps the only time I was legitimately scared out of the water anywhere near Santa Barbara. When Slater faceplants, I tend to get the impulse to get outta the water. That day in December (I think it was the 5th), that was the ultimate. It was the best, heaviest surf I’ve seen in Santa Barbara ever, and I’ve only seen waves like that here perhaps once more– that same year in February.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So you can imagine how stoked I was on my college experience when I came to school and was treated with a surf date with surfing’s biggest star amidst epic waves. I was ecstatic. Any surfer who asked me what I thought about SB surf, I’d have blown my load all over them in my excitement to tell them about my Slater sighting.</p>\n<p>You see, I grew up in Northern California where the water is sharky and the sand is cold black. Most days at my home beachbreak, people don’t sunbathe. They wear hiking boots, jeans and a coat to trek the beach. There are a few stellar weeks a year when the coarse, pebbly sand is bathed in sunlight and you’ll see more than a few swimsuits. The waves are good up north, but prone to get choppy and windy on the drop of a hat. Clean lines and gentle tubes are the things of dreamers up there.</p>\n<p>Here in Santa Barbara the waves are so tame for the majority of the year that you don’t face nearly as many dangers as you would surfing a more consistent, powerful piece of coastline. SB is not the best place for surf unless you know where you’re going and you are informed about tides, winds, swell movement, locals, gun-toting security and big fishies. Except when the occasional west swell shoots in past the goddamn Channel Islands and blesses us with some real surf, then you might just get to see some waves.</p>\n<p>But the surf kinda stopped coming in so strong after that first big swell my freshman year. It just slowed to a trickle, and hasn’t quite ever come back to full force, in my eyes.</p>\n<p>I’m hoping for the surf to build this year as global warming harshens — that’s what the scientists have been telling us:  good for surfers, bad for pretty much the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>If that doesn’t happen though, I’d encourage all newbie and hopeful surfers (‘groms’, per se) to grab a board and learn how to surf on these gentle little ‘SB nuggets —  I sure as hell won’t be getting in your way at Campus.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus Surf Columnist Elliott Rosenfeld came to S.B. for three reasons: the surf, the women and school: in that order.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25845\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25845\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-23/nostalgic-good-sb-surf/","id":2299,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2298,2297,2296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld","biography":"Not available","articles":[2122,2138,2149,2167,2259,2288,2298,2299,2381,2765,2788,2794,2862,2892,3000,3128,3161,3529,3534],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Honor the Sport of Kings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When I was asked to write a surf column for this issue, I immediately started fearing for my safety.

As Prof. Sweeney would tell you in his Geography of Surfing class, waves are a commodity: it’s all about scale.</p>\n<p>Most surfers know the blissful rush that accompanies a ride, the satisfaction of a big whack off the top, the feeling of being home in the strangely muted roar of a barrel. Best of all, a surfer knows the joy that comes with leaving the water after a good sesh as you strip off your wetsuit (unless you’re lucky enough to be in tropical waters), blow giant salty snot loads out your shnoz and take a moment to reflect on your waves, the water and the sun.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When your mind is in the right place, surfing provides exercise and spiritual orgasm at the same time. I can remember the best five barrels of my life. They also happen to rank among some of the best moments of my life.</p>\n<p>But it can be disappointing when you get to your feet on a decent wave and barely hint at pumping down the line—only to pull off the wave a moment later as some kook launches his polka-dotted 7’9″ hybrid twin fin straight at your dome with face-smashing, skin-splitting, tooth-knocking force. (“Oh sorry brah, was I in your way? Why were you going right? I totally thought Rincon was a left…”)</p>\n<p>So here’s my disclaimer: If you want to be a surfer, you’ve got to earn it. And that means doing your homework. Although it may look easy at times, surfing is no joke. The ocean is no joke. The animals in the ocean are no joke (I still have problems with the ‘S’ word). Big waves are no joke. Sharp fiberglass fins and pointed epoxy noses are no joke. Rip tides are no joke. Spitting barrels over dry coral reef are no joke. Necrotizing fasciitis (from coral infections) is no joke. If you want to be a surfer, you’ve got to act as a beginner of any craft or sport would: cautiously at first, and always respectful.</p>\n<p>Read Shaun Thompson’s <em>The Surfer’s Code</em>. He’s the world’s first professional surfer and he still shreds a stick better than you’ll ever be able to (locally to boot!). Memorize it. Pay attention to every rule, especially the following: “<em>I will never turn my back on the ocean.” </em>Surfers far better than you or me (R.I.P. Mark Foo, Malik Joyeux) have lost their lives to the ocean.</p>\n<p>It may take some time, but once you’ve found your footing on your board, come to understand the right of way rules in a crowd and learned to pick out the right times of day to go for a surf, you’ve probably also learned how to get your ass cussed out viciously by a local and how to avoid drowning as you simultaneously drink gallons of salt water through your nose and tumble around underwater like a Mexican jumping bean. Or at least you should have.</p>\n<p>If you are attempting to carry on surfing as a life passion, you are probably going to experience a shit-ton more dangerous, adrenaline-spiking situations in the water. And you’re probably also going to spend a gazillion hours a day fantasizing about warm water, moderate off-shore winds and empty lineups. Actually, you’re also going to spend thousands of dollars on surfboards, wetsuits, gas, plane tickets, hostels, taxis, hospitals, taco stands and surf videos in your quest for the ultimate ride, the perfect session, the hidden spot you’ve traveled the world to find.</p>\n<p>So all you wannabes, stop your itching to be able to say “gnarly” in casual conversation. The G bomb is reserved for those who have experienced the gnarly. Your day will come. Until then, I will just do my part to follow Thompson’s ninth rule: <em>I will pass on my stoke to a non-surfer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em> surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld is shocked by how many masturbation innuendos exist in surf slang.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-08-04/honor-sport-kings/","id":2298,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2297,2296,2295],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LeBron is No Leader","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I’m not mad at LeBron for ditching his home town.

However, the greater U.S. population cared much less as soon as he said “South Beach.” On a side note, does anyone in South Beach actually care about anything but topless sunbathing, partying at the Clevelander (ironic name, isn’t it?) or watching endless re-runs of “The Golden Girls?”</p>\n<p>In Lebron’s decision, the thumpin’ and bumpin’ nightclubs and magnetic draw of upbeat Miami beat out the home cooking of the self-proclaimed “Sixth City,” whatever the heck that means. “The Decision” does not sit comfortably with many, but in the end, it was one that LeBron had the right to make.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because of his love and loyalty to the state of Ohio and all the people in it, I do not believe that he would have announced his decision as he did without the LRMR marketing squad squawking in his ear. However, I am not letting Bron-Bron off the hook completely, as I believe he really did want to go to Miami.</p>\n<p>As I was watching the nonstop LeBron-a-thon coverage over the past couple of weeks, a couple of things dawned on me. First, watching LeBron and the Clevelandettes prance around the basketball court doing little dances, super-duper great secret handshakes and Ashton Kutcher-style pranks suggests that LeBron just wanted to be part of the pack. </p>\n<p>He never wanted to be the leader. He thrived amid the company of others, and did his best when he was playing with not only teammates, but his friends. There is a reason he refers to his high school years as his glory days.</p>\n<p>In so many ways LeBron is a “me-first” kind of guy, as shown by his 15-minute postgame interview when he referred to himself in the third person about five times. However, on the basketball court, he often takes the opposite approach. His pass-first mentality mirrors Magic Johnson’s game more than MJ’s or (shudder) Kobe’s. LeBron’s move to Miami proves that the game is all about the fun. It’s just a bummer that LeBron the person can’t be as unselfish.</p>\n<p>I do hate comparing Kobe to LeBron, or Kobe to Jordan, or Jordan to LeBron or any combination of those three players being compared. It’s phooey. Stupid. Each player is his own player. One may have accumulated a higher assist average than the other, whereas the other had a better shooting percentage, but less rebounds, etc. No matter the statistics, the fact of the matter is that LeBron will never have that killer instinct or that unrelenting drive that kept, and continues to keep, players like Kobe and Jordan up at night.</p>\n<p>Kobe and Jordan have a combination of confidence bordering on cockiness, determination and talent to make them great, to make them want to be the leader. LeBron may have the talent, but he isn’t a leader. His move to Miami, D-Wade’s city, shows not only a reluctance to put the game on his shoulders, but a lack of desire to be in the same conversation as the other greats.</p>\n<p>In the end, LeBron wanted that burden lifted. Dwayne Wade lifts that burden. LeBron may win championships, but joining Miami was LeBron’s way of giving up the throne that could have someday been his and his alone. As a basketball fan with no vested interest in Cleveland and its sports teams, LeBron’s move to Miami is sad not just because he left behind die-hard fans for a beach party, but also because we learned who LeBron really is.</p>\n<p>Perhaps our disappointment is our own fault. Maybe we shouldn’t have tried to make a follower — albeit a really awesome one — into a leader. Even so, next season will be fun, no matter how it plays out.</p>\n<p>We learned a lot this free-agency season about the true nature of coddled sports stars, and perhaps we were reminded of the pitfalls of turning professional athletes into role models. However, we ultimately learned one thing from the whole Miami fiasco: the King has left the building.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>It is crucial for the Associated Students (A.S.) internal vice president (IVP) to be seen as a neutral and non-polarizing figure, as the IVP is responsible for leading a Senate full of students with varying views.</p>\n<p>This past year, Pimentel served as an off-campus senator, co-chaired the Senate Internal Committee and was a policy intern at the I.V. Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s platform is focused on the accountability of A.S. senators with an emphasis on ensuring that senators are active and effective liaisons to their BCUs.</p>\n<p>While Pimentel has experience in A.S., the resolutions he has authored have been mostly positional and not directional, which means they represent symbolic measures and not direct actions. Pimentel helped author a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and hate speech, along with a resolution condemning cyber-bullying.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus </em>acknowledges the importance of positional resolutions, Pimentel’s resolutions do not involve concrete action.</p>\n<p>Pimentel’s opponent, current On-Campus Senator Steven Ho, has accomplished more directional work during his time on Senate, such as authoring a resolution to demand the resignation of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director and helping with the demands of undocumented students on campus through the organization Improving Dreams Equality Access And Success (I.D.E.A.S.).</p>\n<p>Ho explained the work he has done on Senate but lacked a tangible plan on how he would organize the Senate itself.</p>\n<p>Pimentel expressed plans to hold “one-on-ones” with senators to hear about their goals and plans and offer them help.</p>\n<p>He also wants to create a written contract that states the exact responsibilities of each senator and how much honoraria a senator will be docked if a responsibility is not completed as a way to hold officials accountable.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> is impressed with Pimentel’s plan to “revitalize public forums” during Senate meetings. Often, public forum can create a hostile environment for discussion of controversial topics, so a new approach might be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Pimentel hopes to expand the roles and duties of the campus visibility director to bridge the gap between A.S. and the student body.</p>\n<p>If Pimentel can successfully incorporate new accountability measures for senators and support more tangible and directional bills, we believe he will be an effective and diplomatic internal vice president.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/anthony-pimentel-for-internal-vice-president/","id":2296,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2295,2294,2293],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
