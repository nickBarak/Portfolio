As a freshman, Palomares was a huge offensive surge as she reeled in 50 hits and had an average of .307 overall, ranking her second on the team behind Soria.</p>\n<p>The presence of Palomares last year beautifully complemented the “small-ball” style of play that the Gauchos present by getting on base and creating scoring opportunities for the team.</p>\n<p>Another player who is sure to make some noise for Santa Barbara this weekend is junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom. Wisdom, a former Big West Freshman of the year and All Big West team selection, is a double-sided knife for the Gauchos on the diamond with outstanding defense and offense.</p>\n<p>Last year she stood in the circle almost twice as much as any other pitcher with 43 appearances, 27 of them being starts. She pitched a total of 193.1 innings, while no other pitchers reached 100 innings on the year, and recorded an earned run average of 3.19, 136 strikeouts and 17 wins.</p>\n<p>Her defense in the circle is dominating but it is not limited to pitching, as the coaching staff is no stranger to sticking the junior in the outfield on days that she doesn’t pitch or even after they bring in another pitcher. This strategy used by head coach Brie Galicinao is without a doubt to keep her on the field for offense.</p>\n<p>Last year Wisdom ranked third on the team in batting average with .299 and first in RBI’s as she drove in 41 for UCSB. Her ability to get big hits (.545 SLG%, 8 HR’s) provides a surge for the Gauchos that allows the team to take control of games early and for her to close out the match with her arms. Anytime a player can superbly provide their own run support, they will surely be a threat to any team. Her Babe-Ruth-like style has made her very valuable to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Being that this is the opening of the season for the Gauchos, look to see an appearance from some of the new additions of the team. In the off-season UCSB picked up six freshman, three outfielders, two infielders and a pitcher. With some proficient and disciplined play by the Gauchos this weekend, these younger players will get a chance to put their cleats on NCAA grass for the first time.</p>\n<p>First pitch will be thrown at 10 a.m. Friday morning against Dayton at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53883\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53883\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/ucsb-opens-its-season-this-weekend-at-home/","id":1026,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[1025,1024,1023],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles","biography":"Not available","articles":[78,81,85,86,101,103,108,110,111,113,115,116,120,122,125,127,129,130,132,140,141,142,145,148,151,156,160,161,165,180,181,448,523,584,627,924,925,927,957,958,960,978,980,1008,1010,1011,1012,1015,1026,1027,1030,1031,1036,1047,1049,1050,1073,1082,1084,1089,1766,1770,1771,1987,1989,1997,2019,2026,2027,2034,3288,3297],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Takes Two in Final Series of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7801.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_MarkBrocher_02.15.2013_DSC_7801.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB softball team played its final games of the season this past weekend, taking two out of three home games against UC Riverside.

Soria led off with a single to start things off and three batters later, Jennings hit a single to right field to bring Soria home and give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was kind of perfect in [Keilani and Jessica’s] first at bats of their last games that they were able to put up the first run,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB’s early momentum was ended in the second inning when junior outfielder Dionne Anderson tied the game off a sac fly by freshman third baseman Brittanie Akey.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders kept the pressure on with four more runs, aided by two Gaucho errors in the fourth inning to go up 5-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB stayed resilient and fought back. The Gauchos tacked on two runs in the bottom of the fourth, first by junior first baseman Lauren Boser off a single by freshman catcher Samantha Stark, and next by junior outfielder McKenzie Kane off a ground out by sophomore pitcher Shelby Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Riverside eventually pulled away in the sixth inning, scoring four runs on six hits and killing the Gauchos’ chances for a comeback. UCSB didn’t have an answer in the final two innings, losing with a final score of 9-3.</p>\n<p>“Riverside came out hitting and swinging well today and we just couldn’t match them offensively,” Galicinao said. “We didn’t have the same performances [as Friday], but offensively we could’ve come out a lot stronger today. We just couldn’t keep up.”</p>\n<p>The previous game was a much more balanced effort for the Gauchos on both sides of the ball. The team came out firing with Wisdom and Soria scoring the first two runs of the game off a double by Jennings. Junior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil followed up with a double of her own to bring Jennings home and give UCSB an early 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Alex Pingree was solid as she has been all year, giving up no runs and striking out four batters in five innings played.</p>\n<p>Wisdom knocked a solo homer over center field, her eighth homer of the season, and finished the game pitching the last two innings as UCSB won 5-1.</p>\n<p>“On Friday we strung hits together a little bit better,” Jennings said. “[Saturday] we just had a rough defense and didn’t get those clutch hits.”</p>\n<p>The first game of the weekend was a struggle on the offensive side for both teams, but one run by freshman outfielder Arianna Palomares in the first inning was enough to seal a 1-0 UCSB win.</p>\n<p>Wisdom was masterful in the circle, striking out nine batters and shutting out the Highlanders as she pitched a full seven innings.</p>\n<p>“We started [the weekend] out really great, we were really excited,” Jennings said. “Overall we had a pretty good weekend.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51330\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51330\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/ucsb-takes-two-in-final-series-of-the-year/","id":1023,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1022,1021,1020],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Softball Brings in Six New Recruits Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SoftballGame15_KevinYang_05.10.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SoftballGame15_KevinYang_05.10.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One year after finishing just a win short of the Big West Conference title, the UCSB softball team took a step back this season as they ended with a .500 conference record and a fourth-place finish. �...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One year after finishing just a win short of the Big West Conference title, the UCSB softball team took a step back this season as they ended with a .500 conference record and a fourth-place finish.</p>\n<p>“A lot of those freshmen got game experience and they filled some pretty key roles for us,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They had some big performances, and there’s a lot of room for them to get even better physically and mentally.

The gifted 6’1” athlete has not only signed on to play pitcher aside standouts sophomore Shelby Wisdom and freshman Alex Pingree, but she will also be playing for UCSB volleyball in the fall. In her junior year, she struck out 277 batters and maintained a .429 batting average.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have five pitchers and she’ll also be playing volleyball here at UCSB too,” Galiciano said. “She can come in and make an impact right away.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos were generally solid on defense this past season, they struggled to put up runs at times. Incoming outfielder and three-time Fountain Valley Offensive Player of the Year Emily Brucelas should be able to help with the offensive woes.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a transition going from high school to travel to college, but she’ll be a hitter who can adjust playing at this level,” Galicinao said. “She’s pretty aggressive offensively and I think she’ll be pretty consistent at this level.”</p>\n<p>Another player with good potential to help on the offensive side is Texas native Kristen Clark. With a good swing and great speed, she can also help fill in the outfield, an area that was once controlled by Soria’s speed.</p>\n<p>“She’s somebody who’s fast from the right side, but she can hit for power and also play the short game,” Galicinao said. “She’s pretty softball-savvy and just an all-around athlete.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the depth of the outfield is Sunkist League MVP Stacy Cavazos. In her senior year, she hit at an incredible .544 clip and had 54 RBI.</p>\n<p>“She’s the other fast one,” Galicinao said. “She’s a triple threat that hits from the left side and can also hit it over the fence. After she signed on, she asked what she should do. I said ‘Just stay fast,’ and she did.”</p>\n<p>While most of the other recruits are versatile players who can play multiple positions, local native utility Rieanna Thomas is the only one who will have it in her job description. As a utility, she will be able to chip in by playing multiple positions on the field.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruits is outfielder Jackie Hinojosa from Saint Francis High School. In her junior year, she had a .531 batting average and scored 22 runs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the speed and versatility of the incoming freshmen should make an instant impact. If the new players can complement the experience of the current team, UCSB could see a return to the top next season.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kevin Yang of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51536\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/softball-brings-in-six-new-recruits-next-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51536\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/softball-brings-in-six-new-recruits-next-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/softball-brings-in-six-new-recruits-next-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/softball-brings-in-six-new-recruits-next-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/softball-brings-in-six-new-recruits-next-season/","id":1025,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1024,1023,1022],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season Hosting Last Place UC Riverside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team plays its final three games of the season this weekend against UC Riverside.

Jennings has been outstanding all year on offense and defense, currently sitting at number one in the Big West in assists with 140 and first on her team with nine home runs.</p>\n<p>Soria has played her role as the Gauchos’ leadoff batter even better than she did in her impressive junior campaign. She is second in the Big West in stolen bases with 22 and leads her team in hits (59), batting average (.328) and at bats (180).</p>\n<p>“This year has been a roller coaster,” Wisdom said. “It’s been a tough, yet fun year, and the one thing I’ll miss most about it is the great seniors that we had.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos as a team have struggled to put up runs over the past couple months, but the offensive production has picked up considerably in the last two weeks, most notably when they scored nine runs against Hawaii and in an 8-0 win against Cal State Northridge in which six different players had an RBI.</p>\n<p>“We played some of our best games in Hawaii, because as a team we were locked in and playing as one unit,” third baseman Jessica Reichner said. “We just need to stay loose and keep playing for each other.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has continued to follow the lead of Wisdom on defense and offense as it has all year. Although her ERA has seen a steady drop to 3.22, her team-leading 39 RBI is still second in the conference.</p>\n<p>“As a team we have been stringing in hits and hitting the ball hard,” Wisdom said. “If we continue to do that we’ll get wins [this weekend].”</p>\n<p>UC Riverside enters this weekend with the worst record in the Big West. While their offense is not bad, currently in fourth place in the conference in on base percentage, the Highlanders own the conference’s worst ERA by far at 5.16.</p>\n<p>However, UCSB will still have to be wary of UCR’s strongest offensive weapons in senior outfielders Kayla White and Ariel Shore. White is fourth in the Big West in home runs with 11, second in batting average at .371, and first in triples with four. Shore leads the conference with 25 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>“Our team just needs to keep playing strong and fighting like we always do to come out with the wins this weekend,” Reichner said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ final games of the season are at Campus Diamond with games at noon and 2 p.m. on Friday and noon on Saturday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_Vandenbelt1.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"590247305\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51269\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51271\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/ucsb-ends-season-hosting-last-place-uc-riverside/softball_vandenbelt-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_Vandenbelt1.jpeg?fit=854%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"854,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Softball_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_Vandenbelt1.jpeg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_Vandenbelt1.jpeg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51271\" alt=\"Softball_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Softball_Vandenbelt1-166x250.jpeg?resize=166%2C250\" width=\"166\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 9, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51269\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/ucsb-ends-season-hosting-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51269\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/ucsb-ends-season-hosting-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/ucsb-ends-season-hosting-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/ucsb-ends-season-hosting-last-place-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-09/ucsb-ends-season-hosting-last-place-uc-riverside/","id":1024,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1023,1022,1021],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
