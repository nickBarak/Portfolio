Anyone can text in at any time, and a trained student supporter will respond,” Kothari said. “It’s just a way to vent, or if you need to get something off your chest and you feel like you can’t go to anyone else, this is very easy and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kothari heard about Lean On Me from a friend at another university and decided to bring the organization to UCSB. UCSB is the first UC to have a Lean On Me chapter, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The national organization handled the logistical end of setting up the hotline, Kothari said. Kothari and the rest of Lean On Me’s executive board act as the people “on the ground” who publicize the hotline and help train the student supporters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Lean On Me chapter spent the second half of Winter Quarter and the first half of Spring Quarter recruiting the 18 student supporters who are responsible for responding to the texts that are sent to the hotline. The application process involved both an online application and an interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student supporter went through a four-hour online training session provided by the national organization, along with a three-hour in-person workshop led by Lean On Me executive board members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The online training was a lot about empathy and vulnerability and just being open to listening to people,” Kothari said. “The workshop training was more hands-on. We went through a lot of different scenarios.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main two things are validating responses and validating how a person feels and how you do that, and then asking open-ended questions. Let the person… tell you what they want to tell you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The training also involved educating the student supporters about other resources in the local area so that they are able to refer people who text the hotline to those resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have systems in place if something does seem very serious… they’d alert the national team and get the person’s phone number if they’re in danger and then we can give that phone number to UCPD to get the person help if need be,” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone texts the hotline, they have to agree to a list of terms and conditions before a student supporter can reach out to them. 30 people have texted the hotline since its launch on Monday, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were just testing it out the first day. The text was like ‘hey, I’m just testing this out to see if it’s real,’ and we’d be like ‘yeah, it’s real, it’s working, you’ve got us!’” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people have been using it for what it’s meant for, whether they’re stressed, they have mild mental health issues, eating disorders, family grief, whatever it might be, and we’re here to help.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Talbert, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, is one of the 18 student supporters. She has exchanged texts with two people since the hotline’s launch on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main point is to make sure they know that there’s a lot of resources out there and that this is a good starting point if they need to go further, and if not, this is a good place to just… talk it out, basically,” Talbert said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some text conversations have lasted more than a day, while some are as short as 30 minutes, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To publicize the hotline, Lean On Me has been tabling in the Arbor and plans to put up flyers around campus and Isla Vista soon, Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean On Me also wants to form partnerships with Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and UCSB Health &amp; Wellness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has a lot of their own problems and their own things that they’re dealing with and sometimes it’s not easy to tell a friend or find someone to help you,” Kothari said. “C.A.P.S. is a great resource for sure but it can’t handle such a large school and the large amount of students that we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hotline’s number is (805) 874-5888.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said there were 12 student supporters.

Graduate Student Association (APIGSA) and the Asian American Studies Department spoke about their experiences at the university and grievances they hold with the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several speakers talked about the lack of resources allocated for Asian and Asian American students on campus, with some noting that almost one third of UCSB’s student population identifies as Asian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smita Narasimhan, social media coordinator for Pan Asian Network, talked about the failure of the university to recognize the many identities within the label of Asian or Asian American. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We come from so many diverse cultures, languages, religions and we need to embrace all of that, but by designating all of us under one umbrella with one word, that’s taking all those differences away,” Narasimhan said during the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narasimhan said she hopes the fulfillment of the demands will create a campus where her Asian identity will be acknowledged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

at the rally, urging students to “mobilize and organize” to create the changes needed for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fujino said that not only do the 2019 demands

We’re not gonna let this go,” Anderson said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Anderson, the demands come down to an essential problem with how the Asian and Asian-American communities are seen on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are invisible. Our needs aren’t being met and people just assume that we’re gonna be okay because it is a reinforcement of the model minority idea that Asian and Asian-American students are gonna make do.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biography is the culmination of decades of work, Stewart said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart began research on Locke in 1977 while in graduate school at Yale University. He dropped the project for a long period of time but resumed writing the biography in 1992.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went away from it because it was so challenging … It was a very complex project. I didn’t feel like early on, coming out of graduate school, I could write the book. I had to grow as a writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart made use of Howard University’s exhaustive collection of Locke’s personal correspondences to paint a picture of Locke’s philosophy, life experiences, conflicts and interpersonal relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professor at Howard University, Locke left the bulk of his letters with the institution, where they were compiled in the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart pored over thousands of documents in the process of writing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He has voluminous letters. He had probably 5000 letters to his mother alone… He would report on what he did and where he went almost like a diary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike historical counterparts such as Booker T. Washington or W. E. B. Du Bois, who focused on social advancement through economic efficacy and protest respectively, Locke looked at the arts and saw an opportunity to connect white audiences with Black creators, Stewart said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s like a facilitator. He’s like a producer of these things. He did it out of a belief that art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke popularized the works of Black artists and authors such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and others who “started doing poems and short stories and novels about the Black experience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that “art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Almost like a Trojan Horse, [art] could be rode into the citadel of American culture and there would be poetry and art and all about Black people which would humanize how people thought about Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke faced challenges relating to his disposition, his size, his sexuality and his focus on art over other forms of activism. In the greater Black cultural narrative, Stewart believes Locke was overlooked because of these peculiarities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take somebody like Frederick Douglass. He’s independent, a leader, a spokesperson. He’s heterosexual, he has a family. It’s like it’s the mirror of the white world, but Black. Locke was small. He was 4’11″. He weighed 99 pounds. He was into art, which is not typically the focus of Black politics. He was a difficult personality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke’s challenges gave him a unique perspective on life, and his success and resilience in the face of dismissiveness from other activists inspired Stewart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He never let the opposition from other people stop him, whether it was gendered or sexual, or racial, or even the issue of his size, or those people who thought that art was ridiculous to be concerned about when you’re in the midst of a racial struggle.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87719\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1536383264\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87708\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87719\" data-attachment-id=\"87719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/ucsb-professor-wins-pulitzer-prize/unnamed-1-28/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"335,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=335%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also significant to Stewart was Locke’s faith in the Black cultural capacity for change and reinvention, away from the ideals and standards imposed by white people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that in altering one’s conception of oneself and embracing one’s innate qualities as a Black person, one could “acquire and gain a sense of self-esteem and agency that [one could] never acquire by trying to get what the other people have,” Stewart said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So there’s a narrative of self-sufficiency and self-determination through art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke also led a life of lonesomeness which intensified after the death of the most prominent figure in Locke’s life: his mother.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of his life was after her death in 1922, a search for someone to replace her… and he never found that,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was coupled with a desire for a meaningful relationship with a man, which Locke could never fulfill, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had relationships but never anything that was really permanent. He felt people would get with him because of what he could do for them, they used him. He was a means, not an end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke was a perpetual optimist deep down, even in his dying moments. In every aspect of his life, whether it be romantic pursuits, academic ambitions or social activism, Locke never let seemingly insurmountable disadvantages discourage him, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart believes young people can learn from Locke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That kind of relates to today, I think. A lot of young people come out and look at the situation. There’s a lot of controversy… but [Locke] was always hopeful, always thinking that by contributing you could make a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This signature concept of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The New Negro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that Black people reinvented themselves in the 20th century, away from slavery… There’s this idea that wherever you are in your life, whatever has happened, you still have the capacity for a new version of yourself,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His whole thing is, well, if you believe you can change, then maybe you can.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

routes in Santa Barbara and Goleta to improve the timing and efficiency of routes. The line 28 adjustments were drafted by Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and UC Santa Barbara and are scheduled to come into effect on Aug. 19.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding another bus to line 28 will allow buses to pass by every 10 minutes instead of the current 15-minute intervals, according to Hillary Blackerby, interim planning and marketing manager for SBMTD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line 28 was established in August 2016 as part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>. The plan details campus development up to 2025 through changes in programs, transportation and housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB funds the operation of the shuttle. The quarterly lock-in student fee of $13.13 is based on enrollment in UCSB and allows students to ride the bus for free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby approached the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) at its April 23 meeting as part of SBMTD’s annual April outreach to inform the board of the proposed bus route changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby noted buses are often filled to capacity along El Colegio Road due to the high amount of students headed toward campus. Many of these students are what she describes as “line-neutral.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t care which [bus] you get on because you know whichever one you get on, it’s going to wind up at campus,” Blackerby said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When people are really just trying to get to campus, they’re filling up lines that have destinations past campus, like downtown.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buses headed toward campus are filled to capacity and exclude people farther down El Colegio as a consequence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 60-foot segmented buses with a standing load of 110 people were originally purchased for line 15x, but instead became used for line 28 due to higher demand. Even now, these buses are still reaching capacity and leaving people behind, according to Blackerby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She hopes the additional line 28 bus will relieve the overcrowding problems on other El Colegio buses, such as lines 7, 11 and 24x.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
