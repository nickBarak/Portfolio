The Crimson have not had to leave the friendly confines of home for their trip to Ohio for ITA Kickoff Weekend on January 29, 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, Harvard is hoping to get their first away victory on the road trip as they look to gain more away experience for the three conference games that are at away sites. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has been playing well as of late, going 2-1 over this past weekend. The Gauchos have been able to find success in both singles and doubles play and will look to continue that success against the Harvard Crimson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doubles play for UCSB has been excellent lately as the pair of junior Amanda Atanasson and senior Stefani Stojic has earned three doubles set victories since being paired up for the first time since their game against the New Mexico Lobos on March 5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tandem of junior Palina Dubavets and senior Melissa Baker has also performed well since being paired up, holding a 2-1 record in doubles play so far. Both tandems have helped UCSB secure doubles points in three of their last four matches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Crimson duos have also done well this season as Freshmen Irene Lu and Natasha Gonzalez lead the Crimson in doubles record at 8-2, along with the pair of senior June Lee and sophomore Erica Oosterhout who hold an 11-7 record. The efforts in doubles play from the Crimson has been successful, with the team currently on a five-game streak of earning the doubles point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The doubles play from both teams has been strong recently, and the matchup between the two looks to be fairly even, as the teams each have reliable tandems that have found their winning ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In singles play, UCSB has been able to string together multiple winning streaks against their most recent opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In their games against the University of San Diego Toreros and the University of Denver Pioneers, the Gauchos stormed for four consecutive wins in their respective sets; the efforts were a significant factor in UCSB leaving with two 5-2 victories. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the team suffered a tough loss to No. 11 Pepperdine 5-2, the result in singles play against the Harvard Crimson should be much more even, especially if the Gauchos can find the winning rhythm that allowed them to dominate singles play just a weekend ago. It should be an exciting match as both teams prepare to enter conference play next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will host Harvard University on Saturday, March 18, at 11 a.m. PST at the Rec Cen Courts.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76516\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76516\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-16/ucsb-hosts-harvard-after-loss-at-no-11-pepperdine/","id":1160,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1159,1158,1157],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez","biography":"Not available","articles":[45,52,64,67,68,69,71,1111,1132,1136,1160,1162,1165,1169,1170,1172,1197,1201,1202,1204,1205,1377,1380,1383,1388,1399,1497,1921,3342,4097,4106,4111,4266,4268,4270,4273,4274,4282,4287,4819,4822,4828,4889,4891,4892,4893],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Breanna Stewart Tragedy","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BreannaStewart_foulshot-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BreannaStewart_foulshot-1.jpg?resize=709%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I am personally responsible for Breanna Stewart tearing her Achilles over the weekend in the EuroLeague title game.

After leading her Russian team Dynamo Kursk to the title game, Stewart rolled up on fellow WNBA star Britney Griner, rupturing her Achilles in the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just months prior, Stewart had experienced one of the highs of her young career, lifting the WNBA championship trophy for the first time as the Seattle Storm swept the Washington Mystics, earning finals MVP in the process. During the regular season, Stewart averaged 21.8 ppg and 8.4 rpg en-route to earn league MVP honors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, because she played in a game that a player of her caliber should not have to play in to make a decent living, Stewart loses a valuable year of her prime, the Seattle Storm lose their superstar for the season and the WNBA loses one of their most marketable players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, all because of a devastating injury that should never have occurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is it possible that the MVP of the premier women’s basketball league in the world doesn’t make more than $56,000? It starts with a faulty collective bargaining agreement (CBA) — one that can, should and will likely change in the coming years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When WNBA players complain about their salary in comparison to their male counterparts, they don’t expect to get equal pay; obviously, the men’s game makes more money. No, what they want is a similar share of the profits. In the NBA, 50 percent of the total money is allocated to player salaries; in the WNBA, that number hovers around 20 percent. Double Stewart’s salary, and maybe she wouldn’t have to play overseas — instead opting to give her body a much deserved rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that doesn’t explain the whole story, including why the WNBA has consistently lost money over the past 10 years. For that, I blame myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always tried to advocate for women’s basketball; as a 12-year-old, I vividly remember writing in my journal, trying to make a successful marketing plan for the WNBA. What I failed to understand as a young, naive kid was the nature of the main force holding the WNBA back: sexism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve all heard the common arguments made by men against women’s basketball: it’s boring, the women can’t dunk and,“I’m a waaaay better basketball player than these women.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last point especially pisses me off, because it manifests itself even in pickup basketball. One of my best friends plays pickup with me weekly, and every time she makes a shot, the game always stops for a minute so everybody can clap and congratulate her. In reality, she’s played more minutes of organized basketball than they ever will in their lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I had the privilege of beat-writing for the UCSB women’s basketball team, and I saw first-hand the skill, effort and tactics that went into a game. I will guarantee that freshman point guard Danae Miller could cross over anyone I know, regardless of gender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the first two arguments, women’s basketball may be played below the rim, but that makes it no less exciting to hoop nerds like myself. Because there is less reliance on raw athleticism, WNBA players are some of the craftiest finishers around the rim. And in stark contrast to the men’s game, the women’s game relies much less on the three-pointer, which is very refreshing to watch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, back to my opening sentence: I blame myself because I haven’t done nearly enough to combat this sexism. Yes, I tell my friends they’re dead wrong when they say they can beat women in one-on-ones, but that shouldn’t be seen as an accomplishment. In my six years of being a part of the press, this is my first-ever WNBA article. That needs to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I challenge any basketball fan who is reading this article to watch a WNBA game with an open mind and see what you think. Rather than deriding the players for their inability to dunk, praise them for their backdoor passes, their ridiculous finishes near the rim and their ability to knock down big three’s with the clock winding down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breanna Stewart tore her Achilles because men refuse to give women’s basketball a chance, and because men who do support women’s basketball haven’t done an effective job in advocating for the sport.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That changes now.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Jerry West took an already stellar defensive team and added the two best defensive wings in the game. They are the favorites to win it all and it is very clear why.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 2 Seed: Denver Nuggets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nuggets looked like a strong team that fought and clawed its way to the No. 2 seed this prior season with a very young roster. Eventually losing in the second round in a game seven, the Nuggets added depth and athleticism with Jerami Grant. The team performed phenomenally. However, with no set small forward in their rotation and the defensive issues from starting point guard Jamal Murray, there are concerns that need to be addressed going into the next season. The Denver squad will be a very good team, but are still one or two years off from being a true contender.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 3 seed: LA Lakers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakers on paper look like a very scary team. An Anthony Davis and LeBron James pick and roll is every team’s worst nightmare, especially when Danny Green is spotting up for a three in the wing. Running LeBron at the point, this roster is huge and will present a lot of problems for teams offensively and on the boards. Notice how I didn’t say defensively there. With the prevalence of stretch fives, it’s not too hard to scheme around Anthony Davis’ abilities as a rim protector. In addition, DeMarcus Cousins and LeBron James leave much to be desired defensively. Going into year 17, LeBron is definitely not playing the best defense of his career and Cousins, who was always a step slower, has just suffered two major injuries to his knee and quadricep and is thus going to be a huge asterisk defensively. Davis is also known for getting knicks and knacks here and there that keep him out for short periods of time, but in this neck-and-neck Western Conference, that will cost LA some games and their seeding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 seed: Houston Rockets</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Houston may have started falling apart before our very eyes after being eliminated by a Kevin Durant less Warriors team. Chris Paul and James Harden are feuding because of the playstyle they play – which favors Harden and no one else. It’s clear that the players and administration have lost all faith in Head Coach Mike D’antoni and Free Agency did not go in their favor at all as they did not sign any notable Free agents and are set to run it back with almost the same team. Here’s the catch however: GM Daryl Morey might of just saved all of their blunders by trading for a league MVP and former teammate of James Harden, Russel Westbrook. Their isolation playstyle has not panned out now 3 years in a row and is unlikely to work a 4th, but with Westbrook and Hardens pre-existing chemistry and D’antoni reverting back to his Phoenix offense rather than his current iso offense, Houston has effectively reopened their window for a championship. They switched out an aging star with injury concerns to replace him with a high octane player who has a reputation for being the ironman of the NBA. There are concerns with Westbrook’s scoring efficiency, but the elite level playmaking he brings to any squad is well worth any offensive concern one might have.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 5 seed: Utah Jazz</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utah has been one very strong defensive unit that has stukk largely underperformed in the playoffs due to offensive inconsistencies. The addition of veteran Mike Conley Jr. and ISO scorer Bojan Bogdanovi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address their one glaring concern and could make Utah a dark horse threat in a close Western Conference, especially if Donovan Mitchell can take that next step and play at an all-star level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. 6 seed: Portland Trail Blazers</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portland was notorious as a team that did really well seeding wise but could never take that next step and convert regular-season success to playoff success. All of this changed when they made the Western Conference finals last year. They accomplished this feat without their third star Jusuf Nurki</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ć</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who suffered an injury late in the season leading up to the playoffs. So why are they seeded so low? They lost one of their key roleplayers Seth Curry in Free agency and its unlikely they get the same production from Rodney Hood going forward. Nurkic who was already a defensive liability has just taken a lower leg injury which won’t bode well defensively. The Trail Blazers 2 man duo of Lillard and McCollum can only carry this team so far on their own without a clear cut third option, and adding Hasan Whiteside who is little more than an elite rebounder does little to solve this problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7 seed: Golden State Warriors</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know what you’re saying, they made the finals the last 5 years straight how are they suddenly a 7 seed. Losing Kevin Durant is bad, especially since Klay Thompson is injured as well, but on top of this the Dubs lost backup guard Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, and Andre Iguodala. All of that and the only addition is D’angelo Russel. Yes Russel is an All Star, yes he is an exciting young player. But the fit next to Steph is frankly terrible. Both are defensive liabilities and D’angelo Russel is extremely pick and roll dependent while the Warriors run very little Pick and Roll and instead prefer a very fluid ball movement offense. Also what’s Russels fit when Klay comes back? Are Steph, Klay, and Russel going to be on the court together, if so that lineup will be extremely undersized especially compared to the rest of the Western Conference teams, which all have notable size to take advantage of smaller lineups. Furthermore the Raptors showed how easy it was to neutralize Curry when he was the sole offensive option with a Box and 1 Defense. In conclusion the warriors lost their best player to Free Agency as well as the little depth that they had to add a player who is ill fitting to their game plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 seed: Sacramento Kings</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Kings have done a lot of things right in the last few years. They got rid of bad contracts and built a deep young team from the draft and brought in pieces to facilitate their young nucleus’ growth. They have stellar perimeter play from Bogdan Bogdonovic (not to be confused with Bojan Bogdonovic), Buddy Hield, and De’aaron Fox as well as a versatile and athletic front court with Marvin Bagley III and Dewane Dedmon. This team then resigns a talented young wing in Harrison Barnes and signs veteran perimeter defender Trevor Ariza – while also adding depth to the backcourt by adding Corey Joseph. This team was trending toward a playoff berth without all of their additions, but with their recent acquisitions the Kings are poised to take the next step while also allowing their young core enough freedom to continue their development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89332\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89332\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/","id":1159,"author":{"id":23,"name":"Nithesh Perumal"},"related":[1158,1157,1156],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Finals Preview: Curry’s Legacy and the Bench Matchup","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2019-05-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/basketball.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/basketball.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Steph Curry has always been the most important player for the Warriors, and his impact since Kevin Durant has gone down has been immeasurable.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Both fans and media personalities questioned whether or not the Warriors would even make the Finals, believing that they had lost the series against the Houston Rockets the moment Durant went down with his injury.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Warriors relied on their star point guard who would drop 33 points, all in the second half of Game 6, to put away the Rockets and advance to the Conference Finals.</p>\n<p>Yet, even after Curry’s Game 6 performance, many doubted he could lead the Warriors past the scorching Portland Trailblazers who upset both the media favorite Oklahoma City Thunder and second seed Denver Nuggets.</p>\n<p>NBA Hall of Famer and TNT Analyst Charles Barkley predicted that the Trailblazers would make the Finals, and even went as far to say “the Warriors have no chance of winning without Kevin Durant.”</p>\n<p>Curry’s legacy has been in question since Durant joined the Warriors, which caused his scoring to take a minor drop.</p>\n<p>As such, analysts and fans believed that Curry’s time as the greatest point guard in the NBA has gone, having been surpassed by Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, to name a few.</p>\n<p>To silence his naysayers, Curry played monstrously in the Conference Finals averaging 36.5 points per game along with 8.3 rebounds and 7.3 assists in a 4-0 series rout of the Blazers to reach the NBA Finals.</p>\n<p>The Warriors will be in the Finals for the fifth straight time being only the second team to do so, since the Boston Celtics, led by Bill Russell, did back in the ‘60s.</p>\n<p>Curry has played the previous four, but has never won an NBA Finals MVP. While Curry has mentioned that he prefers to win the championship over the award, it’s precisely his lack of a Finals MVP that people question his legacy.</p>\n<p>With Durant out for the first game and possibly the second (or longer), it’s up to Steph Curry to once again carry the load and remind the rest of the NBA why he was the first to ever be awarded MVP unanimously.</p>\n<p>This is Curry’s opportunity to showcase his offensive arsenal and prove to the world that the Warriors are still his team.</p>\n<p>Curry has a chance to once and for all shut up his critics, and claim the award that’s rightfully his.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Between Leonard, Lowry, Curry and Thompson, the NBA Finals has more than enough all-stars to keep an eye on this Thursday. Besides these players and the rest of the Raptors’ and Warriors’ starting lineups, however, is a bench full of players equally crucial to securing a championship ring.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the Toronto Raptors have been known for having a deep bench and relying heavily on rotations. But, as we know, this year is not like the rest for the Canadian franchise. As showcased in the Eastern conference finals, Coach Nick Nurse has stuck to a steady eight-man rotation, which includes Fred VanVleet, Serge Ibaka and Norman Powell.</p>\n<p>Most outstandingly, the trio’s combined 48 points during Game 4 against the Bucks attests to their newfound place in the Raptors’ lineup. Powell and VanVleet make up the first- and second-highest marks in three-point shooters off the bench in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Since the birth of his second child prior to Game Four, VanVleet’s performance has improved greatly. Coincidence or not, his average three-point percentage over Games 4, 5 and 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals stands at 85.9% —  significantly higher than it’s been all season — going 3-3, 7-9 and 4-5, respectively. His recent success may even open up a spot for him as starting point guard in the upcoming finals.</p>\n<p>Serge Ibaka’s defensive game has been consistent for the Raptors come postseason. With his steady inside coverage, mobility and acute eye for rebounds, the 6’10” center can be very useful going against a strong offensive team like the Warriors.</p>\n<p>Norman Powell’s minutes and shooting percentage from the field have nearly doubled since the conference semifinals back in the beginning of the month. Powell will enter the NBA Finals this Thursday on a hot streak after marking a lofty 74 points during the Eastern Conference Finals — a tremendous improvement to the mere 21 points he tallied in the semifinals.</p>\n<p>As for Golden State, their bench remains a bit more unpredictable. After a calf injury took out Kevin Durant back against the Rockets, the Warriors have had to lean on their bench more than anticipated this postseason. Now giving more starting time to players like Kevon Looney, Coach Steve Kerr relies more heavily on bench rotations; consequently, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jonas Jerebko and Shaun Livingston have been spending more time on the court.</p>\n<p>In the conference finals against Portland, McKinnie really stepped up his game. Though inconsistent throughout the majority of regular and postseason, McKinnie’s shot has gradually become more reliable, scoring 12 points in Game 4 versus Portland — the most he’s racked since nearly October.</p>\n<p>The star of the Warriors second unit so far however has been center Kevon Looney.</p>\n<p>Looney has been a stabilizing force on both sides of the ball, gobbling up rebounds and finishing at the rim like an elite big man. His matchup with Marc Gasol will be pivotal, and if he continues to play with the intensity he had last year the Warriors will be in good position to win.</p>\n<p>It may be, though, that ultimately the Raptors have the edge when it comes to their bench. Equipped with three key players who have demonstrated their ability to compete and change games at the very least threatens the defending champs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f0ad4d38c0da837cc79f764e12b16e5?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/leonard-paulasa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Leonard Paulasa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Staff writer and photographer.
