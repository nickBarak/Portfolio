Nonetheless, the Gauchos have relied on their depth all season as anyone of the five starters can pop off on a given night.</p>\n<p>All five concurrent starters are averaging double-figures while seven different Gauchos have led the team in scoring during a single contest.</p>\n<p>As for Beach, it’s been a somewhat disappointing season, although there is one silver-lining. Senior guard Deishaun Booker has carried the Niners with 18.1 points per contest, currently third in the Big West, and has surpassed Leon Wood’s single-season free-throw record, previously set at 211 in 1984, with three regular season games left on their schedule.</p>\n<p>Not only has the Las Vegas native made the most single-season free throws in Big West history, but he’s knocked them down with an unprecedented 90.4 percent from the line this season, the top mark in the conference.</p>\n<p>Booker has made the most of his senior campaign, despite only five conference wins for Long Beach who currently sits in the seventh spot of the conference standings.</p>\n<p>In their last meeting, Booker posted a compelling 25 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists while shooting 12-15 from the stripe.</p>\n<p>The 49ers rely on scoring from Booker, redshirt senior Temidayo Yussuf, and redshirt senior guard Bryan Alberts, and although Booker has had a career year, this was not the season that Long Beach stated with all of its top scorers out the door at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, Booker hasn’t been himself from the field as of late. Beach is coming off of two late-game wins against sixth place Northridge and eighth place UC Riverside, but its star senior has shot just 8-29, a disheartening 27 percent from the field in those contests.</p>\n<p>With Long Beach coming to town, this is the Gauchos’ last home game of the year as they face three of the bottom four teams in the Big West to close out the regular season.</p>\n<p>During handshakes against Long Beach in their last matchup, things got chippy between UCSB and the Niners, so things are expected to get chippy with Beach playing with its season on the line.</p>\n<p>If that wasn’t enough to convince you to support, all fans are entered into two raffles with chances to win either a pair of Coachella tickets or a pair of AirPods.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. on Thursday evening in the Thunderdome as Santa Barbara hosts Long Beach State in a battle of the beach during the Gauchos 2019 senior night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86535\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/battle-of-the-beach-gauchos-host-long-beach-for-senior-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86535\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/battle-of-the-beach-gauchos-host-long-beach-for-senior-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/battle-of-the-beach-gauchos-host-long-beach-for-senior-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/battle-of-the-beach-gauchos-host-long-beach-for-senior-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/battle-of-the-beach-gauchos-host-long-beach-for-senior-night/","id":1125,"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton"},"related":[1124,1123,1122],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":36,"name":"Max Kelton","biography":"Not available","articles":[55,91,93,98,106,977,998,1001,1007,1009,1035,1038,1041,1042,1044,1045,1046,1064,1070,1077,1081,1083,1117,1125,1126,1154,1244,1247,1250,1252,1265,1270,1271,1328,1339,1341,1345,1350,1354,1355,1358,3396,4830,4833],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Who’s Who in the County","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Whether you are a first year student or fifth year veteran, it is essential to recognize the movers and shakers within the county.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Whether you are a first year student or fifth year veteran, it is essential to recognize the movers and shakers within the county.

With the advantage of hosting these next two matchups, the team will have a unique opportunity to turn the tide back in its favor and finish out conference play strong.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the season, UCSB currently stands at an overall record of 17-8, and a pair of wins this week would be enough to bring the win percentage back above the .700 mark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ conference record of 6-5 has them as a middle-of-the-table team at the moment, in terms of Big West league standings. Although the team’s away record of 5-6 isn’t all that exciting, its 10-2 home record should inspire the possibility of getting back on track this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all goes well, the Gauchos can carry that momentum into next week, when they’ll host Long Beach State for the final home game of the regular season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s opponent will feature a Hawai’i side that has been on a roll as of late. The Rainbow Warriors stand at an overall record of 16-9 on the season but have won five of their last seven matches, with the Gauchos taking responsibility for one of those losses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’ll be coming off back-to-back wins, with their most recent resulting in an 87-64 victory over UC Riverside.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, the UCSB versus Hawai’i all-time series has been thoroughly level, with an even 11-11 record in the 22 times these two sides have faced each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Cal State Fullerton, the Titans have seemingly found their form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although their overall record of 12-13 on the season doesn’t speak volumes, their 8-3 conference record does. Currently on a three-game win streak, Cal State Fullerton will be coming off a 78-71 road win over CSUN last time out. However, the Titans’ away record of 4-9 may favor the Gauchos’ dominance when defending the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two sides are historically familiar with each other, as the Gauchos only hold a slight all-time series lead of 47-40 in the 87 total matchups experienced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players to watch this week for the Gauchos include the backcourt tandem of sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey and junior guard Max Heidegger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the game against UC Irvine last time out, both players reached double-digit scoring. Heidegger led all Gaucho scorers with 17 points to his name, to go along with his stat line of three assists and two steals. Meanwhile, Ramsey appeared to be all over the court with his team-leading six rebounds on the night, along with a stat line of 11 points, three assists and two steals of his own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Hawai’i, sophomore guard Drew Buggs and senior forward Jack Purchase appear to be the offensive catalysts for their side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buggs is a top-five scorer for the Rainbow Warriors, but he is best known for his playmaking skills considering he leads Hawai’i in total assists, by a wide margin, with 144 to his name — over a third of the team’s combined assists output.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchase, on the other hand, leads his team in total scoring with 295 points on the season, while coming in second in most rebounds for his side with a total of 150.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the senior-guard show for the Titans, as Kyle Allman Jr. and Khalil Ahmad are the ones to watch for Cal State Fullerton. With only four points separating the two, Allman Jr. leads the Titans in total scoring with 444 as Ahmad follows closely with 440. Both players also find themselves in the top four of their team’s assists and rebounds category, and UCSB should expect their presence all over the court come game time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the action starts this Thursday, Feb. 21 , as the Gauchos host Hawai’i at 8 p.m., then Cal State Fullerton comes to town on Saturday, Feb. 23, with tip-off set for 7 p.m. Both bouts are set to take place at the Thunderdome.       </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, Huskie pitcher Madi Schreyer held Clark at third by popping up star freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer to end the threat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s tough schedule would only continue on Saturday as it faced two of the toughest teams in the tournament: 25</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ranked Texas A&amp;M and 4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ranked Louisiana State University.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texas A&amp;M showed no mercy as they scored 8 runs in the first inning against the Gauchos, walking away with a 13-5 victory in just five innings.  UCSB did score runs in three of the five innings, plating two big runs in the second on senior catcher Samantha Stark’s clutch double to left center scoring both Altmeyer and junior infielder Emily Brucelas.  Stark came home with the third run of the inning when junior outfielder Stacy Cavazos singled into right center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the day against LSU, the Gauchos fared better, holding the Tigers to just one run through the first four innings.  However in the fifth, LSU knocked in four runs on three hits and an error, and the Tigers ended up taking the win 5-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho senior starter Ashley Ludlow pitched a complete game and worked hard for all six innings against LSU, allowing five runs (three earned) on seven hits, and striking out four.  On offense, the Gauchos out hit the Tigers 11-7, which were the most hits given up by LSU all season.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos did have a chance to score early on LSU, as leadoff hitter Kristen Clark singled, followed by another solid single by Palomares, putting runners on first and second with nobody out.  Sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston then bunted Clark and Palomares into scoring position with one out.  After that, LSU pitcher Sydney Smith shutdown the Gauchos, striking out Altmeyer and popping up Brucelas to end the inning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clark had another great game at the plate for Santa Barbara, going 3-for-3, and is now batting .485 on the season.  Palomares also had three hits to go with her team-high two RBIs.  Unfortunately, the heart of the Gauchos order left 6 runners stranded in the game, going a collective 0 for 7 at the plate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB finished the weekend with a much better outcome, shutting down Bethune-Cookman with a 4-1 victory.  The Wildcats scored their lone run of the game in the second, however that was all the Gauchos would allow.  The Gauchos took over the game starting in the third when Palamores scored off of an Altmeyer RBI single to left field.  UCSB went on to score two more runs in the fourth, and their last run of the game in the sixth.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brucelas had a strong game with a double and two runs scored.  Ludlow came on in relief and pitched a solid game, striking out 10 and giving up 6 hits over the final 5 and 1/3 as she collected the win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will host their first tournament of the season this weekend, the Gaucho Classic I.  The first pitch will be thrown out at 8:30 on Friday morning, against South Carolina.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
