The Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both said in their endorsement interviews that they hope to take advantage of the lobbying process and fight for legislation that supports student needs, Karnsrithong has no personal lobbying experience and lacks his opponent’s fluency in drafting legislation and reviewing policy. This is imperative, as the duty of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is to represent student needs on the UC, state and federal level through means such as lobbying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Karnsrithong struggled to answer basic questions about major student issues, including those about Title IX and even what the role of the EVPSA is. He did not seem to have any concrete platform points that he wanted to accomplish if elected, nor an understanding of what exactly an executive position demands of an individual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, the Nexus does not believe Karnsrithong is a competitive candidate, particularly juxtaposed with Reynolds, who has done a lot of advocacy work outside of A.S. already. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus was impressed with the depth of Reynolds’ platform points, as her well-planned and thought-out approach makes achieving her goals more likely if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having worked on a number of bills with Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the representative for Santa Barbara County in the State Senate, Reynolds’ legislative experience adds to her ability to advocate for student needs and would aid her in achieving her main goals as EVPSA: providing basic needs for all communities, providing equitable financial aid, increasing funding for mental health resources on campus, protecting survivors’ rights and lobbying for policies to diversify the UC Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Reynolds expanded her background with legislation and policy when she joined SASA as a policy analyst. There, she organized UC Santa Barbara students’ lobbying efforts against United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ proposed amendments to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Department of Education is currently reviewing Title IX, Reynolds believes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“it’s extremely important that survivors, and all students who could potentially become survivors, are protected from regulations that could detrimentally change the course of their cases and their lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, she plans to make use of the EVPSA’s statewide advocacy platform and her lobbying experience to fight for survivors and “uphold Obama-era Title IX policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both agree that Title IX is not effective in its current form, Karnsrithong’s only experience with its policies come from his training as a resident assistant, and he was unable to speak specifically to what changes in Title IX policy needed to be made.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Reynolds does not have previous experience working inside the EVPSA office, she has worked closely with the office and Lobby Corps to host SASA’s first-ever Sexual Assault Awareness Month last April. During that month, she used her legislative experience to explain bills pertaining to sexual assault to students who signed up to lobby.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds became SASA’s president and UCSB director during her junior year. In her new roles, Reynolds worked to increase awareness about sexual assault and gender bias by organzing summits and town halls — many of which were scheduled to take place in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and have now been canceled due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her involvement with SASA, she also helped create Isla Vista’s first-ever </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-15/center-dedicated-to-helping-victims-of-sexual-violence-opens-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2019, the product of a partnership between the Isla Vista Community Services District and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds is also experienced with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Student Association, necessary for the role of EVPSA, who is required to meet with the UC president on behalf of the student body frequently. She currently serves as UCSB’s undergraduate representative to the Title IX Student Advisory Board. Altogether, her history of working directly with the UC Student Association and the UCOP speaks to her qualifications for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of basic needs, Reynolds plans to lobby for legislation that would push the UC to provide better mental health services for students. She also plans to expand the role of Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Campus Advocacy Resource &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) through increased funding and a “more diverse staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also hopes to alleviate food insecurity by working with the A.S. Food Bank and lobbying for legislation that provides support to those who are food insecure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all fighting for these basic needs as college students. And there shouldn’t be the fact that we have to have certain communities fight harder for them,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds hopes to uplift marginalized groups by facilitating direct feedback from them but maintains that she would not speak on their behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think prioritizing not only marginalized communities that are very visible in the community, but also ones that may be less visible, like the undocumented students at UCSB, is important,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain transparency within the EVPSA office — something that Reynolds believes the current EVPSA, Daevionne Beasley, could have done better — she plans to hold town hall-style events where students can come together and hear about the work the EVPSA office is putting out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the nature of the EVPSA office’s budget, Reynolds wants to publicize the office’s expense reports, as “students should know exactly where their student fees are going.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at Reynolds’ work so far, it’s clear that as EVPSA, she would have the experience and drive to continue advocating for students, albeit with a much larger platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My passion for students’ needs and for elevating students’ voices is instrumental in this work,” she said. “I don’t think you can do this type of work without having that passion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Karnsrithong waited an extra year to run for EVPSA and taken the time to hone the skills necessary for the role, he could have been a strong contender. But this year, that is not the case. For the 2020-21 EVPSA term, Reynolds’ qualifications speak for themselves, and the Nexus is certain that she’s the right candidate for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

2018, and the three-goal comeback against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League last year. Those were certainly nice moments. But they never felt indicative of broader success; rather, they felt lucky. United fans were happy we finished second because, frankly, we didn’t deserve to (thank you, David de Gea). United fans were happy we came back against PSG because we knew we lacked the quality to compete with a team of that caliber — something United proved when they flamed out in the next round against Barcelona.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But on Wednesday, when Manchester United dismantled Sheffield United 3-0, I felt hope.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I say dismantled because, well, the 3-0 scoreline doesn’t do justice to the performance. After two early goals, Manchester United was content to maintain possession, forcing the Blades to chase the ball around for most of the second half. The Red Devils kept 68% possession on Wednesday, while outshooting Sheffield United 13-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be transparent, it was a lackluster performance from Sheffield United, who have looked less-than-stellar since the restart. While the Blades still sit in an impressive eighth place, they’ve looked much more like the newly promoted side they are in recent times, rather than the team that was pushing to qualify for the Champions League back in March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Wednesday’s performance was bigger than gaudy stats, bigger than an underwhelming opponent. No, Wednesday’s performance was a blueprint to future success for Manchester United.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Manchester United acquired creative maestor Bruno Fernandes in January, pundits and fans alike have wondered how Fernandes could coexist with star French international Paul Pogba, who had spent most of the season on the sidelines with an ankle injury. In February and March — without Pogba — Fernandes displayed his quality, racking up 4 goals and 3 assists as an attacking midfielder. Fernandes’ ability to play a killer pass, as well as his lethal long-range shot, allowed Manchester United to better break down opponents playing a low defensive block.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a healthy Pogba, however, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had to devise a plan in which the two could play together. While both offer creativity and quality going forward, both also oftentimes struggle on the defensive end. Many pundits speculated that playing both together would cause problems for United’s back four.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it remains to be seen how the two perform together against a top opponent, Wednesday’s performance should help disprove that theory. Solskjaer employed Pogba as a deep-lying playmaker, which enabled him to control the pace of the game while still providing cover for the back line. Although not quite as dangerous going forward as he usually is, Pogba still had the ability to play dangerous through balls — which he successfully did throughout the game. Meanwhile, Fernandes operated in his favored attacking midfielder role, linking up with Pogba and the front three on multiple occasions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, Solskjaer utilized veteran midfielder Nemanja Matic as a holding midfielder who acted as the glue that kept the entire formation functional. There’s no doubt that the 31-year-old has lost a step in recent years; with Pogba and Fernandes ahead of him on the pitch, however, they don’t need his pace. Instead, Matic operated just in front of the full-backs, sniffing out any counterattacking chances that Sheffield United had when Pogba opted to move up the pitch into the attacking third.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be clear, Manchester United wasn’t flawless on Wednesday. Marcus Rashford — Manchester United’s top goal scorer this season — missed a few easy chances, although his passing was pristine. The Red Devils still desperately need a right winger: Mason Greenwood is great, but he’s a far better second-striker than winger. The backline of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof — as solid as it’s been this season — still struggled against pacy counterattacks. And striker Anthony Martial won’t be able to score a hat trick every game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Manchester United wants to challenge for the title next season instead of fighting for a Champions League berth, it will need to improve on all of these fronts while renewing the contract of Pogba.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the first time in recent memory, however, there’s a clear path ahead for Manchester United. It may not be much, but after everything that has gone wrong in the past seven years for the Red Devils, it’s a welcome start.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

400;\">For more than a month, soccer fans have clung desperately to any semblance of soccer. The Belarusian Premier League — which has unwisely kept playing in the wake of COVID-19 — has drawn record-breaking viewership numbers. I myself was so desperate for sporting content that I sat through an entire FIFA match between England internationals Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford (spoiler: their FIFA skills are far inferior to their real-life skills). With no end in sight, I’ve had to get my soccer fix through patchy World Cup highlight videos, Instagram Live and copious amounts of Football Manager 2020. Needless to say, it’s been rough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But finally, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday, two German minister presidents — Markus S</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">öder </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Armin Laschet  — expressed optimism that the </span><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-bundesliga-return-to-action-on-may-9-definitely-possible/a-53193629\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bundesliga could return May 9</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While the official date will be decided later next week, it likely won’t vary far from this May 9 date. Germany has been coordinated and efficient in their COVID-19 response, and just recently started opening up the country. With a plethora of tests at their disposal, playing the Bundesliga behind closed doors in the near future seems both pragmatic and possible.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you thinking “Great, soccer is back, but who cares about the Bundesliga!?,” well, evidently we all do now. In case you didn’t care previously, though, here’s a short guide on the league to catch you up to date and help you prepare mentally for the return.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>Can Anyone Catch Bayern?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With nine games left in the season, perennial juggernaut Bayern Munich leads the table, four points clear of second place Borussia Dortmund and five points clear of RB Leipzig. Remarkably, Bayern is seeking their eighth consecutive Bundesliga title, although of late the Baverian giants have appeared far more mortal than in the past. Bayern sacked their previous manager, Niko </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kovač,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in early November after a tumultuous start to the season, but under new manager Hansi Flick, the club hasn’t lost any competitions since December 7. Bayern’s success this year rests squarely on the shoulders of 31-year-old Polish striker Robert Lewandowski, who has bagged a remarkable 25 goals in only 23 games played. Defensively, Bayern is as solid as ever, led by Manuel Neuer — who seems to have rediscovered his form this season. Still, Bayern has proven their vulnerability this season, especially when Lewandowksi doesn’t find the back of the net. With an away match at Dortmund remaining, the league is anything but finished.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>Dortmund: The Inconsistent Challengers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the world saw Dortmund play, the Western German side blew a 2-1 aggregate lead to Paris Saint-Germain in the second leg of their Champions League fixture. That about sums up this Dortmund side: limitless potential, but with youth and a defense that has been shockingly leaky for a team with title ambitions. Since signing Erling Braut Haaland in the winter transfer window, Dortmund has featured one of the most lethal attacks in all of soccer. Already, the 19-year-old wunderkind has bagged nine goals for the German side, while 20-year-old Sancho has used his pace and technique on the wing to contribute 14 goals and 16 assists. With established German internationals Mats Hummels and Marco Reus in the side, talent has never been the issue. Consistency, on the other hand, has often plagued Dortmund, like in their 4-3 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in February. While the odds remain against Dortmund, don’t count out one of the most explosive teams in Europe.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>RB Leipzig: The Early Bloomers </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a seemingly less realistic pick to win the Bundesliga, Leipzig sit only 5 points back of Bayern for first place and 1 point back of Dortmund for second place. After a torrid start to the season, Leipzig have cooled off considerably, with draws in their last two league games. Nevertheless, this side showed the world what it can do when it dismantled Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 on aggregate in the Champions League. Star forward Timo Werner leads the front line with 21 goals in 25 games, and Austrian international Marcel Sabitzer has proved to be an admirable secondary option with 8 goals and 6 assists in the league so far. Having already played Bayern twice this season, however, it will take a collapse from the Bavarian giants for Leipzig to swoop in for the title.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roblew.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1353438342\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"94075\"> </a></p>\n<p><b>The Others: Borussia M</b><b>ö</b><b>nchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It remains unlikely that either of these teams will win the title: Borussia Mönchengladbach sits 6 points back of Bayern and Bayer Leverkusen sits 8 points back of the leaders. However, both these teams play Bayern again this season, and therefore will play a crucial role in determining the champion. In addition, these two teams are vying against one another for the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By most metrics, Mönchengladbach have significantly overachieved this season. Led by Swiss international keeper Yann Sommer, Mönchengladbach’s back line has been pivotal in their success this season. While Mönchengladbach lacks the star quality of their rivals, their attack has proved to be efficient, with French forward Alassane </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pléa</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> leading the team with 8 goals in 22 games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, Bayer Leverkusen has an abundance of talent, but have yet to fully put together the performances the side is capable of. Midfielder Kai Havertz is one of the premier talents in the league, and has put together solid performance after solid performance in what is almost assuredly his final season for the side. Elsewhere, veteran Karim Bellarabi continues to shine, while 22-year-old Leon Bailey has shown glimpses of his massive potential. An injury to leading goal scorer Kevin Volland significantly dampers the potential of this team, but there are still enough pieces to vy for fourth place.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Six applicants will then be selected after applications close on June 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Klock, the process innovation program manager of the College of Letters &amp; Science Information Technology (I.T.) department, explained that a visit to Westmont College in Santa Barbara served as a major catalyst for the internships. In observing Westmont I.T. interns, she noted that “it [was] extraordinary what the students are capable of” as they worked alongside faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klock stressed that UCSB’s internships are open to anyone “who’s really wanting this” and that they’re “not just looking for the coder.” All majors, she said — including humanities and social sciences majors — who demonstrate creativity, motivation and “a desire to learn something new” are welcome to apply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Explore, dream and discover,” Klock summarized. “Coding can be taught.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although interns will be positioned in different departments and will be working with different sets of software, Klock said that students will still meet regularly to share their progress, talk about their experiences and present their work to administrators. The objective is to foster a sense of camaraderie among all six interns and prepare them for the “real world,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief among the program’s considerations, Klock said, is to increase student involvement on campus and to “keep these students working for the UC and inside the UC family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We only have what is known as ‘one deep’ structures in many of our IT operations,” Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for I.T. and chief information officer of UCSB, said in an email. “If a person leaves, it leaves a skills and capabilities gap.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution is to “immerse students in I.T. culture,” Klock said. That involves having undergraduates with full administrative privileges directly creating and editing the school’s digital infrastructure, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a win-win,” Hall said. “Employers benefit by lowering the burden of on-boarding well-qualified candidates. And the interns are equipped with practical skill in a high demand field.” Another benefit, he said, would come in the form of “a potential pool of future employees” for the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, the coronavirus put a wrench in the internship plans, but staff members adapted the internship training in order to keep them on pace with the original schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pandemic struck the same month we sent out the application,” Rebecca Carroll, the technical project manager at Enterprise Technology Services, said. As a result, the I.T. department was forced to adapt the program relatively quickly during its shift to working remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carroll explained that internship training will be conducted throughout the summer, through either Zoom meetings or all-expenses-paid online courses like LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight and the UCSB Learning Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For interns who may not have ready access to a device of their own, Carroll said, the department will provide them with laptops, with all of the necessary software pre-installed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Come fall quarter, Klock hopes that students will be able to physically work at the offices on campus “once everything opens up again.” In the meantime, she said her priorities include clear communication and assignments for interns and making sure that “the student is happy in their needs.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results from this year’s pilot internships will inform the next year’s, Klock said, and in the coming years, her goal is to expand the program across the entire UC system.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94276\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94276\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-03/ucsb-information-technology-will-pilot-student-internship-program-in-summer-2020/","id":1796,"author":{"id":237,"name":"Yiu-On Li"},"related":[1795,1794,1793],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
