The initial victim, whose name and student status were not released, reported that she was “contacted via WhatsApp” – a texting app – “from a source she believed to be the Chinese police who said she owed money for unknown fees” between March 2019 and April 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The source allegedly said that if the victim did not send in “a payment,” the victim would be arrested. She was further “asked for her schedule to track her whereabouts and was told not to report anything to law enforcement or she would be arrested,” the timely warning stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since this initial report, the department received additional reports of UCSB international students who have received “phone calls or messages” from “people pretending to be package couriers, police, or Consulate staff who ask for money or personal identifiable information.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impersonators then “threaten to arrest and deport the student if they don’t comply.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCPD is investigating these incidents.

Senate. It seems Solomon has a resolution on the table nearly every week, if not every other week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir drafted three resolutions during her entire term as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon cited their primary reason for running is because they genuinely wanted to help students, and because, having been engaged in so many spaces on campus, they understand what students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon firmly believes in the term “trickle-up social justice,” which they explained as helping the most marginalized, vulnerable people on campus: “the people who have their voices silenced the most.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Solomon’s resume sprawls all over campus – they have worked in Ortega Dining Commons, the Davidson Library, the UCen Bookstore, the A.S. Cashiers and Ticket Office and beyond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, their most prominent role came in being the A.S. Finance and Business Chair, during which they kept track of nearly $15 million dollars in student fees while also holding an unwavering commitment to transparency through weekly graphics that showed students exactly where student fees go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has also reached outside of the senatorial role to organize the Trans Joy Take Over, a survivor solidarity event, and worked hard to promote the A.S. Book Bank in order to help students who may otherwise not be able to afford textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen so many aspects of student life, I feel like that makes me very equipped and qualified,” they said in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kept telling students this year, this is your money. A.S. needs to be less of an elitist thing, it takes work from people within it to share with people out of it and people who don’t know very much about it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their proudest moment as senator came when they drafted a resolution supporting the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\">Black Student Union Demands</a> and were able to see the tangible change being made for Black students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a senatorial candidate in Spring Quarter 2018, Solomon centered their platform on mental health education, pushing for decreased wait times at Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this goal was not nearly unique at the time, Solomon won the most “first” votes out of any other on-campus senator during the Spring Quarter 2018 elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have further solidified relationships with UCSB administration, working with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to lower the fee waiver for students who have been charged in the College Alcohol and Substance Education (C.A.S.E.) program, as well as supporting former A.S. Advisor LaDonte King’s legacy by creating the “King’s A+ For Excellence”  scholarship in his name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said they had to work hard to get that fee lowered. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really had to show them that I’m not just a student who enjoys drinking and wants people to not get charged for that. It’s a serious issue… students were put in really bad financial situations because of the C.A.S.E. fee and sometimes it was just because they were caught with alcohol in a dorm or just very minor things when the real issue is actually binge drinking.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon also has a self-described “working relationship” with the Office of Financial Aid, putting on workshops with them and becoming familiar with the department’s director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They further spoke to their attendance of conferences, noting they have a “really good network” at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. They have learned from those campuses and their student governments with the aim of making UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. better. </span></p>\n<p><b>GOALS IF ELECTED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It appears Solomon has not forgotten the C.A.P.S. goal that they ran on as a senatorial candidate, as Solomon noted in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that, if elected, they want to continue to push for more funding for C.A.P.S., along with a dozen other agenda items, which include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting the Black Student Union Demands;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working to make textbooks more affordable; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating UC-wide coalitions between student activists and student leaders; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pushing the UC President, Janet Napolitano, to make sure students’ voices are heard; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a peer mentor program with the Office of the President, in which students would be more informed about their financial aid and advising options;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing to put out surveys to gauge students’ needs;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S. Book Bank; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a “legitimate” test bank so students can share notes, which Solomon believes will help with retention rates; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating an academic excellence initiative to create part-time jobs through the expansion of the book bank;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a program called Gaucho Career, which is a career development program that would help students get a headstart on a future career;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redesigning the A.S. website so it is more interactive; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S. fellowship;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with the Alumni Association to develop a mentorship program that would connect successful alumni and students;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving beyond just the A.S. Senate’s live stream and live streaming meetings with all administration officials to make them more accessible;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a lock-in fee that would support the cost of gender reassignment surgery, creating a grant similar to the ones given out by the Educational Opportunity Program; </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir is running on a platform of making college more affordable by lobbying legislators, introducing an app that would contain a list of all A.S. resources, purchasing a subscription to Headspace – a guided meditation app – for every student using A.S. monies and putting a vending machine in I.V. that would provide free meals to students with financial need and undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has been working on the latter project during her “gap year” between senate and her candidacy. </span></p>\n<p><b>OUR CONCERNS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acknowledges Solomon has a tendency to lean away from impartiality: a few weeks ago, they went as far as to call the other party “Colonizers United” in a tweet on their Twitter page, which was public at the time. We were disappointed when Solomon did not fully respond to our question about the tweet and a question about a judicial council case they were involved in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They did, however, admit that the tweet was a “momentary lapse” in judgement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Solomon said they would not use their private social media accounts for A.S. and political business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second point of concern with Solomon’s candidacy – and one that gave the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pause when discussing endorsements – was the fact that they deceived the student body during Fall Quarter 2018 by not living amongst their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During their interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Solomon admitted to living off campus during Fall Quarter 2018, a possible violation of their term as an on-campus senator – an offense that fellow On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed from her position for</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They spoke candidly about their situation, citing financial struggles as the reason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the beginning of the year and throughout the summer, I could not afford to live anywhere. So I didn’t have a lease… anywhere fall quarter,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon added that they did tell Internal Vice President Steven Ho about the situation; however, the fact remains that their constituents did not know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was living with a friend until I could afford to pay for winter and spring [quarters]. And I’m in a pretty bad place financially. I was trying to save up money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said the reason they didn’t speak about the issue publicly at the time is because they did not want “the additional burden” that came with the publicity that Salari had experienced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acknowledges that Solomon’s deception was troubling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, given Solomon’s ability to be candid and open with us now, combined with the financial hardships that they had faced, we do not believe this should affect the student body’s decision on who to choose as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus’ </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific concerns, we fully recognize Solomon’s cracks as a candidate are far and few compared to their successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has created change in every corner of this campus. Even those not involved in A.S. circles – which are admittedly rather insulated – know Solomon as someone who has accomplished a lot in their short time at UCSB, a fact the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found as we were deciding who to endorse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon is a current second year, and while we realize that having a third-year A.S. president is a bit unorthodox, they appear to be naturally suited for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are open about their struggles and their qualifications, and aren’t afraid to take on the realities of the job – they noted that their identity as a queer, Black person helps them to understand the struggle of all students, particularly marginalized ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview, Solomon put it aptly: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most marginalized people [on campus] experience all the bugs in a system, like all the things going wrong with the association or the university… We’re able to feel it the most and then we’re able to advocate for them and make this university better in a way that benefits every single student on this campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As echoed before, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that either Solomon or Sir would serve the school well; no matter who takes home a victory on the night of April 25, our school will be in good hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the fact remains: our choice is Solomon – we have faith in them to not only do the job required if elected, but to also go above and beyond to advocate for UCSB students at every possible level. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the April 18, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87568\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/zion-solomon-for-associated-students-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87568\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/zion-solomon-for-associated-students-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/zion-solomon-for-associated-students-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/zion-solomon-for-associated-students-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/zion-solomon-for-associated-students-president/","id":2091,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2090,2089,2088],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Bike Committee worked with Bike Committee Senate Liaison and On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal to develop the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution includes a letter written by the Associated Students (A.S.) Bike Committee, which oversees maintenance of campus bicycle infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The letter criticizes the lack of bicycle parking and infrastructure in the newest design plan for the Student Resource Building (SRB) North Landscaping Design Project. The development plan for the lawn area north of the SRB and south of the bike path would provide more space in the SRB and expand outdoor study space, according to the letter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s vote is in solidarity with the A.S. Bike Committee’s letter, and directs the SRB Governance Board to consider their request to put the project on hold until the design includes improvements to the SRB’s bicycle system.</p>\n<p>The resolution emphasizes how the current bicycle parking situation at the SRB threatens the safety of the campus. Because the bicycle parking lot for the Theater and Dance West building is across the bike path, accessing the SRB is “challenging and dangerous during peak hours,” according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The letter also stated that current parking “poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space.”</p>\n<p>The Bike Committee first became involved with the North Landscaping Design Project in Spring Quarter 2017, and worked with the SRB Governance Board to add bike parking to their original design.</p>\n<p>“The [previous] design included space for approximately 35 bike parking spaces near the SRB main entrance. This space has been eliminated in the most recent proposal, and the Bike Committee hopes that it will be added back in,” A.S. Bike Committee Chair Annie Golay said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and SRB Governance Board Advisor Kim Equinoa said the changes sacrificed more bike parking for programming and study space.</p>\n<p>“The scope was narrowed to include one design area encompassing the grass area north of SRB and south of the bike path. In that transition, the space was designed to maximize programming and study space,” Equinoa said to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>When the A.S. Bike Committee found out the newest design plan did not include new bike space, they wrote a letter directly to the SRB Governance Board detailing why new bike parking is necessary for the SRB.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who wish to go to the Student Resource Building must park in the bike lot adjacent to the Theater and Dance West building. This poses a potential congestion problem if either building facility receive greater traffic than usual, which happens every time a major event is held in either space,” the letter states.</p>\n<p>In response to the resolution, Equinoa said “the SRB Governance Board is open to receiving any feedback and information that can help inform decisions.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

She started off as a fellow her first year, went on to work as the community organizing director and is currently the legislative director in the office.</p>\n<p>She knows the EVPSA office inside out — she knows how to get things done and exactly who to work with to make things happen.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has spent the last three years working behind the scenes, and it’s time for her to be in the spotlight.</p>\n<p>“I think the EVPSA is a very unique position in which it’s not something that you can just come into and know what you’re doing,” Leal Silva said. “There are so many institutions that you’re navigating, so many relationships that have to be formed. Frankly, they get the work done and I think I’ve really put in the groundwork to allow myself to do that work.”</p>\n<p>“I know what a successful office looks like versus one that needs more work. I have worked in every single office that has existed on this campus for the past three years.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has ample experience working with Associated Students (A.S.) Lobby Corps; this past year, she has been working on Senate Bill 24, a bill which would ensure abortion by medication access on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Last year, Leal Silva helped create Coffee and Calls, which provided students with the opportunity to call their senators about certain legislation while having a free cup of coffee in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> asked Leal Silva why she decided to stay working behind the scenes for so long, and her answer further confirmed that she is now ready to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I am a big believer in taking space and leaving space and knowing when to step up and knowing when to take a step back and just do the work,” Leal Silva said. “I’m not ashamed to admit that I wouldn’t have been able to serve our students as well last year.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva made it clear that she will not be affected by any of the drama or toxicity that comes with party politics in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The EVPSA office is such a unique space. It’s one space that, personally, I’ve never seen become enthralled with the drama that sometimes can enthrall A.S.,” she said. “It’s not the sense of superiority or like ‘we’re above it,’ but it’s this sense of knowing… we’re working for something so big, we’re working for ideas that seem so unattainable.”</p>\n<p>“There isn’t time to get caught up in all of it.”</p>\n<p>For the first two years of Leal Silva working in the EVPSA office, the office was “CU-controlled.”</p>\n<p>“For me, it comes down to: Are you down to do the work?” Leal Silva said.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, the boy living on Picasso, the girl living on Sabado… they don’t care about your business. They don’t care about your drama, they just care about how you’re doing work that helps them.”</p>\n<p>If elected, Leal Silva hopes to focus on expanding financial aid and focus specifically on advocating for the Middle Class Scholarship.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also wants to focus on deferred maintenance funding.</p>\n<p>“We need to talk about how Girvetz is in shambles, but we have brand new bioengineering buildings,” Leal Silva said. “Our students should feel like they all have access to this equal level of education and that they’re not being left behind because of their major.”</p>\n<p>“Newsom asks that we add a thousand more students to the UC system. How could we possibly accommodate for those students if we can’t accommodate for the ones we already have?”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva’s maturity and sense of responsibility are two qualities necessary for the EVPSA position, but more than anything, Leal Silva sold the <em>Nexus</em> on her pure passion for the work she does and the goals she has for UCSB if elected into the position.</p>\n<p>“I want UCSB to be a leader of force when it comes to these issues. I want them to think of our campus as an indispensable area of innovation and of creativity and community. I think that we already have it and I think we can do more of it, and I would love to help lead us to that next step.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also referenced the Finance and Business Committee budget reports that On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon has been creating, stating she wants to take similar steps in order to be transparent with the amount of money spent on lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>“I’m very aware that the EVPSA has one of the biggest budgets in A.S. because they do work that needs, frankly, more money,” Leal Silva said. “But being intentional and being like ‘just so you know, this is what we’re doing with the [money]’… can really, I think, strengthen that bond of trust between the student body and the office.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of what the EVPSA office has done to increase transparency during the time Leal Silva has worked in it, Leal Silva said she believes the social media presence of the office has grown over the last three years in order to keep students in the loop, and she hopes the office’s social media presence will continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also showed that she knows exactly who to work with within A.S. for the projects she wants to take on.</p>\n<p>She talked about funding to address food insecurity in I.V., and said she would work with the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs and the A.S. Food Bank. She discussed addressing the holes in Title IX policy, and said she would work with C.A.R.E. and Take Back the Night. Leal Silva also mentioned working with the Human Rights Board to advocate for gun violence legislation.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva is also knowledgeable about UCSB’s role in the United States Students Association (USSA) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<p>“UCSB pays the most dues to the UCSA, which means that when we’re talking about issues, they need to listen to our campus because we’re paying the most money.”</p>\n<p>“I think the money that we do put forth is doing tangible good. It is doing really great things in terms of supporting the undocumented community, in terms of supporting sustainable programs, and in terms of funding the UC,” she added. “As EVPSA, I want to make sure that those benefits are being felt on our campus.”</p>\n<p>This past year, Leal Silva has been serving on the Government Relations Committee of UCSA, which includes the legislative directors of other UCs; Leal Silva has effectively built connections with other UC EVPSA offices already.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned a lot from listening to how Berkeley runs their office, to San Diego, to Santa Cruz, and they all have such critical ways of approaching these issues,” Leal Silva said. “I almost don’t want to compare them because I don’t want the space to feel like a race or like a competition.</p>\n<p>“It very much so should exist as a collaborative space where you’re learning from each other.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also seems committed to doing whatever it takes to help marginalized students on campus and added that she wants to continue to advocate for UCSA’s Undocumented Student’s Lobby Day.</p>\n<p>“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also believes that it wouldn’t be her constituents’ jobs to come to her, but instead, it would be her job to go to them.</p>\n<p>“If you want to know what’s affecting students in the [Muslim Student Association], you have to go to an MSA meeting and sit down and listen. You want to understand what’s affecting students in Indus or MEChA or even CLAS.… go to CLAS and ask the tutors ‘what are you witnessing?’”</p>\n<p>“Go to a C.A.P.S. psychologist [and ask] ‘What services would help you do your job better?’ It’s all very worth it if you want to understand where students are at.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> does believe that Beasley is a capable leader. He is the director of internal affairs for the Coalition for a Better UC (CBUC), and he spoke to the work he has done on one of the CBUC’s goals to expand the Cal Grant.</p>\n<p>Beasley has refreshing ideas. He wants to help stop the UC from doing business with corporations that profit off of prison labor and support formerly incarcerated young adults who apply to UCSB, along with his more common platform point of decreasing the burden of tuition for UC students.</p>\n<p>When asked why he decided to run this year, Beasley said, “I figured it was, you know, prime time because I’ll be going into my third year. I don’t want to do it while I’d be studying abroad my senior year.”</p>\n<p>“I figured if I were to run this quarter, then my term would start while we were still doing the hearings for the bill, so I’d be able to use the resources from the office to be able to try to push this bill and push student issues as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> admires Beasley’s work on the Summer Cal Grant bill, we are concerned that this one bill will end up being his primary focus.</p>\n<p>“I know that he has done a lot of work regarding Cal Grants and financial aid,” Leal Silva said when asked about her opponent.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot to be considered and it can’t be just that.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva added that she’s had the “privilege of working with him and working with his group on the Cal Grant,” and that she believes he is doing “incredible work.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva said that Beasley is “an example of what student leadership is and of what boots-on-the-ground work is,” and she wants to continue to collaborate with Beasley.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has the broad knowledge of issues that are required of the EVPSA to know about, and we do not believe that Beasley has the insight or experience that Leal Silva has.</p>\n<p>When Leal Silva was a first year at UCSB, she applied to a lobbying trip and did not get in. Leal Silva spoke to how disappointed she felt, and she mentioned how the legislative director in the EVPSA office at the time told her that she had to make herself “indispensable” on this campus.</p>\n<p>“[He said] ‘you need to be one of the people that if we’re talking about Title IX, or if we’re talking about financial aid, we think of you automatically as someone we need to have on our team.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has done just that — she has become indispensable on this campus.</p>\n<p>“We have so much potential,” Leal Silva said toward the end of her interview. “If chosen to serve, I would give it everything I had and more.”</p>\n<p>We believe her.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/","id":2090,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2089,2088,2087],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
