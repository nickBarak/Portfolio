Johari Hunt, the event host and a first-year chemistry major, discussed queer history, racism, sexualization of black bodies and the intersection of people of color, social media and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event began with a discussion about queer history and what the minority community within the LGBTQ community looked like throughout the 1900s, specifically “drag ball culture” and the houses in New York that acted as safe spaces and cultural havens for the LGBTQ community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt went on to define racism, prejudice and how the “system of advantage based on race” allows society to understand various forms of oppression. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Racism isn’t defined by someone saying the n-word, but its systematic and institutional,” he said in an interview. “It is whenever a black person says they’re afraid of police. It is being seen as a criminal before you’re even seen as a child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Racism] is … a system involving cultural messages and institutional policies and practices as well as the beliefs and actions of individuals,” Hunt added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting racism and prejudice to the perceptions and stereotypes of masculinity and femininity within the LGBTQ community led to an engaged discussion at the event about the intersections of social media, people of color and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt’s final segment focused on HIV/AIDS history and the fact that HIV and AIDS transmission within the black community has been neglected in conversations about sex. This has led to a lack of visibility about the topic, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During audience discussion, audience members pointed out the history of United States Vice President Mike Pence and the LGBT community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an archived version of </span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20010519165033fw_/http:/cybertext.net/pence/issues.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Vice President Pence’s 2000 congressional campaign addressed the issue of the Ryan White Care Act, which provides federal funding for </span><a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/AIDS patients and was reauthorized by Congress that year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website stated that reauthorization of the act should be completed only after an audit to ensure that federal funding would not be given to organizations that “celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also stated that funding and resources “should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the World Health Organization, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, and about 35 million people have died of HIV. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, 1.1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76975\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76975\"

experiences, like being black and gay or living with HIV, that are not in a research paper or in an article, need to be talked about,” Hunt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said the hardest part of organizing the event was putting something so blatant into context. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he wanted the audience to start a conversation about what it means to be a minority group in the LGBT community and learn about different life experiences within the LGBT community that most people do not realize exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the process of creating the event, Hunt said he thought about issues that gay men face “all the time” and found that masculinity, and what it means to be masculine, is a critical concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then it went to being black as perceived,” Hunt said. “And then I reached the actual sexualization of black bodies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he felt the event presented his central points openly enough to promote and discuss as well as establish future conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wanted his audience to leave “not with answers, but with the willingness to look for them.”</span></p><div

Committee met yesterday evening at the State Street Room in the UCen to hear requests from 18 student organizations for funding.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, the committee decided to fully fund 12 organizations, did not fund one request, tabled two requests and partially funded three requests. Discussion items included the introduction and approval of a new process for distributing honoraria, or monetary compensation, for Program Board officers. Other discussion items included honoraria bill for the Commission on Disability Equality (CODE) that was tabled indefinitely for consideration by the honoraria committee, and a bill to further availability and access of information in A.S. elections code, which was passed.</p>\n<p>Requests granted by the committee included $450 to the University Affairs Committee for honoraria for three student members, $250 for the External Affairs Committee, $75 for the On Campus Senator’s event focused on healthy, productive study foods from the Isla Vista Co-op, $10,550 for the Black Graduates group, $3,840 for La Famille de Colores for tickets and flights for an upcoming conference, $4,000 for the Impact Movement’s national conference in Chicago, $147 for Vocal Motion a cappella group’s fall concert, $80 for Delta Sigma Zeta’s scantrons and bluebooks for a group study session, $400 for the Catalyst Literary Art Magazine third issue launch party, specifically for publicity purposes, to provide propane to keep their upcoming event area warm as well as to provide sculpture transportation.</p>\n<p>The Asian American Christian group EPIC requested and was approved to receive $3,000 for an annual conference held in Orange County at the Doubletree Hotel.<br>\nOfficer for EPIC and fourth-year student Esther Euseon said they needed funding because of their particularly large group this year.</p>\n<p>“We are actually, this year, the largest Christian Asian-American organization on campus,” Euseon said. “We love it when anybody comes to our events.”</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee member and second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said EPIC is very inclusive as a Christian organization, unlike other religious groups on campus.</p>\n<p>“”I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian, in that sense I am Catholic, and honestly they’re pretty chill,” Garcia said. “When organizations say ‘Oh yeah we’re very inclusive,’ it’s hard for people to think they can get into those spaces, but I think with specifically religious organizations they try to make it so they’re as inclusiveness possible.”</p>\n<p>The Art Club requested money for two different events, totaling $1,750, but both were tabled. Representatives from the club will attempt to get money from the Art Department before re-requesting from the Finance Board.</p>\n<p>The Cheer Team also received funding for registration as well as lodging for the USA Nationals competition in Anaheim and a separate competition in Atlanta. The delegated amount was $2,750 out of the $16,780 the team had requested for transportation for future cheer competitions.</p>\n<p>One of Cheer Team’s captains and third-year film and media studies major Nick Gorton-Bufano said this is the first time since 2003 that the team has had both females and males.</p>\n<p>“This is the first year that we’ve been coed since 2003, so that’s cool,” Gorton-Bufano said. “And we gained a lot of support at basketball games from people because we’re co-ed. So we are trying to grow the co-ed aspect as well.”</p>\n<p>Model United Nations also requested $7,332 for extra transportation and housing for their annual Berkeley conference, and received $1,426 to pay for registration fees.</p>\n<p>UCen UStudy, a service that keeps the UCen open for longer than average hours during finals week, received $700 of the $1,085 they asked for to pay for building management to keep Corwin Pavilion open from 1 a.m. – 6 a.m. and to pay for a massage therapist. The Excursion Club received $950 of the $2,750 they requested for I.V. First Fridays, a new events series made to draw people away from Del Playa Drive and the house party scene to provide a large scale source of entertainment in through a variety of activities in I.V., held on the first Friday of every month.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A prior version of this article incorrectly quoted Izeah Garcia as saying ““I’ve been to EPIC and I’m not Protestant or Catholic and honestly they’re pretty chill.” Garcia actually said “I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian in that sense I am Catholic.” The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58790\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58790\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/","id":2407,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2406,2405,2404],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Bill To Allow Priority Registration for ROTC Cadets","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Senate_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Senate passed a bill last week that could allow ROTC cadets to register for classes as early as student athletes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Senate passed a bill last week that could allow ROTC cadets to register for classes as early as student athletes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creation of the bill began approximately seven years ago when the Internal Vice President of the Senate at the time was an ROTC cadet who wanted to resolve the registration concerns of other ROTC members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current A.S.

In the letter, Amato said he supports the potential results that priority registration could bring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I had the opportunity to utilize priority registration, I would have been more competitive in ROTC, better prepared for classes and perhaps had the opportunity to further immerse myself into other activities and clubs around campus, such as the TMP [Technology Management Program] program,” he said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, the interim co-dean of undergraduate education for the College of Letters &amp; Science, said he also supports this bill. He said that with prior registration, those enrolled in the ROTC program would have fewer quarters of academic advising since they will be able to better follow their pre-approved academic schedules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This will benefit the ROTC cadets, and by reducing workload in our understaffed office, indirectly benefit all Letters &amp; Science students,” Stopple said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Senate’s approval, the bill will now be evaluated by the Academic Senate. If it passes there, it will then go into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“ROTC students are a respected portion of the student body and should certainly be rewarded by our school for their dedication and service to the ROTC program,” Hobson said. “I can’t think of any better way to do this than by making their schedules easier by allowing ROTC students to pick their classes with priority.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/","id":2405,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[2404,2403,2402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Campus United Candidate Out of Race for A.S.
