Attorney General Ali Suebert represented Mukai in the case against Salari, arguing that Senator Salari violated legal code by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/on-campus-senator-yasamin-salari-admits-to-living-off-campus-in-violation-of-legal-code/\">living off-campus</a> and that she is unable “to serve and adequately represent her constituents,” according to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition.</a></p>\n<p>“We feel that it is unfair that someone is able to run for a position and campaign as an on-campus senator, getting votes from on-campus students, when other people are running for the same election under the same legal code expecting to have the same laws that they were held to,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Former Off-Campus Senator Alexandra Gessesse, representing Salari, defended Salari on the basis that her off-campus living arrangement does not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents and that her extenuating financial circumstances prevented Salari from living on-campus.</p>\n<p>“Understanding that she doesn’t live within her constituency is real and is a serious matter,” Gessesse said. “But Senator Salari has actively and continuously… supported the constituency in which she is elected to live in.”</p>\n<p>Salari said she based her decision to live off campus on her financial aid reward and changes in her family’s ability to pay for her tuition.</p>\n<p>“I had the fullest intention of living on-campus when I found out I was elected for Senate, however this changed after my election as I received my financial aid package,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Citing financial struggles, Salari said that she and her family “decided that taking out more loans would not be beneficial to my education and long-term academic endeavors.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this, Salari found that her only option would be to live in her sorority house, where her financial aid would cover the costs.</p>\n<p>“I had to fall back on living in my sorority house in order to make sure that my financial aid would cover all the costs for my housing,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Mukai’s attempt to remove her from her Senate position “inherently violates the student bill of rights” in that it would “be taking a leadership position away from an elected student due to circumstances completely out of our hands,” Salari said.</p>\n<p>“Where’s the sense of decency and understanding that students face different struggles?” Salari said.</p>\n<p>Gessesse referred to past incidents in which A.S. Senate granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituency.</p>\n<p>“We [should] ask ourselves what makes Senator Salari different between the one-time exceptions that have been granted in the past,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>But Suebert contends that Senate did not have the authority to grant such exceptions, which would circumvent the power of Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“The only person who is allowed to make exceptions to Legal Code… is the attorney general or the Judicial Council,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>Suebert said that while Senate can re-write or amend Legal Code for future situations, they cannot grant exceptions intended to bypass current Legal Code. These checks and balances of powers with A.S. are designed for fairness among senators, which she said need to be maintained.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to make sure that all students that ran in spring election during the campaign, who also may have faced financial hardship, still are held under the same legal obligations of other students who also ran,” Suebert said.</p>\n<p>The petitioning team called in Lea Toubian, a current on-campus senator, to testify about how living within her constituency affected her ability to fulfill on-campus duties.</p>\n<p>“I think it keeps me more attuned. Since I’m still living [on-campus], it’s pretty relevant to me, but it is difficult to reach all parts of the res-hall community. I think that’s why we have like four different positions,” Tubian said.</p>\n<p>“I feel like I wouldn’t have been able to reach [students living at San Rafael] if I wasn’t an on-campus senator.”</p>\n<p>Toubian also said that running as an on-campus senator as a freshman in the Spring Quarter 2018 election, like Salari, was easier for herself since she already lived in on-campus housing and was familiar with the on campus student community.</p>\n<p>Gessesse countered that although Salari lives off-campus, she is capable of serving her constituency, which can be seen through her involvement in projects such as bring rollover dining common swipes to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Gessesse additionally argued that Salari had, in fact, adhered to Legal Code by meeting with A.S. Elections Board in regards to her living situation. A.S. Elections Board subsequently dismissed the complaint, according to Gessesse.</p>\n<p>Salari’s transparency in regards to her off-campus living situation during a Senate meeting in Fall Quarter 2018 testifies to her compliance with Legal Code and fulfillment of duties as an on-campus senator. Despite living off-campus, Salari “followed all policies that were in place when she was elected,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>The responding team also brought On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon to testify about their experience as an off-campus senator. Solomon testified that the projects they worked on as a senator are determined more by her personal passions than her designated constituency.</p>\n<p>Solomon also testified that Salari’s accessibility to on-campus students was “better than my own,” citing that Salari’s office hours are held on campus and that Salari specifically focuses on on-campus issues.</p>\n<p>At the end of closing statements, Salari asked that the Judicial Council review her case in light of the work she has done for her constituency and the financial circumstances she faced.</p>\n<p>“My work should matter more. That’s what affects students more. That’s what students care about, not where I live and where I can’t afford to live,” Salari said. “My work is directly affecting students and wanting to remove will end those projects that are positively affecting them.”</p>\n<p>Salari also asked that the Judicial Council review her case as an indicator of the changes in Legal Code needed to accommodate the current student body.</p>\n<p>“This is an opportunity for the council to respond to the changing needs of student body and interpret Legal Code accordingly.”</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or sofiamejias@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño, provides elected officials who fail to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in legal code — such as an on-campus senator living off campus, as in the case of On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari — the opportunity to continue serving their terms.</p>\n<p>The elected official would have to obtain approval from both the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, Marisela Marquez.</p>\n<p>The resolution is a modification of Standing Policy 36, which was introduced two Senate meetings ago by Uribe and Briseño. The policy would have given Senate the power to decide whether or not to grant a senator a one-time exception for their situation. The new bill also broadens the scope of the policy from senators to all elected officers.</p>\n<p>However, senators at the Feb. 20 meeting argued that because Senate is a partisan body, they would feel more comfortable if a nonpartisan body or office were in charge of granting the exception.</p>\n<p>“In terms of A.S., they [S.A.G.] are the most non-partisan,” Senator Uribe said at the Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Student Advocate is the only executive position within A.S. that is nonpartisan, as anyone running for the position must run as an independent.</p>\n<p>Aside from shifting the responsibility of reviewing an elected officer’s case to a nonpartisan body, the bill also aims to provide further clarification within the standing policy as it is.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Briseño commented on the ambiguity of A.S. legal code, noting that it is a “gray area” that causes friction amongst A.S. entities, such as when it comes to determining an elected official’s eligibility under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>This bill aims to combat legal code ambiguity problems by providing details to further clarify what factors will be included when reviewing an elected official’s eligibility.</p>\n<p>The resolution notes that “External circumstances, such as to Financial Insecurity, Physical and Mental Health, and experiencing Racism, Queerphobia, Transphobia” will be considered when reviewing the eligibility of an elected officer.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez is the student sponsor on the resolution.</p>\n<p>Martinez did not respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>The bill originates from the Senate’s one-time exception granted to Salari during the Nov. 14 Senate meeting. When the Senate granted Salari the exception, they also included a stipulation to discuss living situations, like her’s, in the A.S. Internal Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is currently hearing a case against Senator Salari regarding her living situation.</p>\n<p>The resolution noted that instances regarding an elected officer’s living arrangements have been presented in prior senates, with “no action to restructure legal code.”</p>\n<p>The resolution will reappear at next Wednesday’s senate meeting.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Hall, behind Cajé Cafe on Embarcadero del Norte – is the closest long-term counseling offered for UC Santa Barbara students, providing individual therapy, group therapy and psychiatry services.</p>\n<p>Acacia was founded in 2014 by Dr. Keith Higginbotham and Dr. Brett Donnelly. The two psychologists noticed a growing demand for mental health services while working at UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>As a result, many students were referred to community providers to ensure consistent scheduling and shorter wait times. However, students faced several barriers to accessing these outside services, such as transportation issues, cost difficulties and provider availability.</p>\n<p>Recognizing these barriers, Higginbotham and Donnelly embraced an opportunity to create an accessible, welcoming therapy center to meet the growing needs of the student population.</p>\n<p>“We made it our mission to help students get the longer term care that they need and really address the barriers,” Higginbotham said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Acacia has been providing services to the I.V. community for upwards of five years. Today, the office works in conjunction with C.A.P.S. to ensure an effective treatment plan for each patient.</p>\n<p>Students seeking treatment first attend C.A.P.S. on campus, where they may be referred for long-term care at Acacia.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. is a really important function in doing crisis work, that short-term treatment, and a lot of the outreach and education. We want to be their premier referral service by providing the best treatment and hiring therapists who are really well-skilled in working with student issues,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>Robbyn Jackson, clinical psychologist and lead director of Acacia’s I.V. office, said he is passionate about successfully serving the needs of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“I see my role as finding the best clinicians I can to meet the needs of the student population. I’m always looking for really good quality therapists who are passionate about the work we do, and make sure that we are helping as many students as possible every week,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The office is also home to Charlie the therapy dog, a trained therapy animal that brightens the I.V. community on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>With more than 16 therapists on staff, Higginbotham said that Acacia has a diverse pool of providers so as to make people with all identities feel welcome in their office. If a therapist at another clinic has an identity that someone is looking for, Acacia hopes to connect them through video sessions.</p>\n<p>Acacia also partners with several other organizations on campus, including C.A.R.E., the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) and the Disabled Students Program (DSP) to ensure quality mental health care to students of all identities.</p>\n<p>“We really appreciate the relationship with the university, to sort of work hand in hand with them, with referrals, understanding what the needs are that they’re seeing. We love to be able to reach out and partner with them as much as we can,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>The Acacia <a href=\"https://www.acaciaroots.org/\">Resources, Outreach, and Outpatient Therapy for Students (R.O.O.T.S)</a> non-profit project is also dedicated to aiding low-income students in accessing mental health services. Students and members of the community consistently raise funds for the project, which go toward mental health education and outreach as well.</p>\n<p>The office also runs the Mental Health Advocates Internship program, in which students that are interested in the psychology field can gain hands-on experience.</p>\n<p>“We do mock therapy sessions together so they can get a feel for what it’s like to be in the field, and they do events and all kinds of stuff for us. It’s a really great opportunity,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to Higginbotham, therapy has the potential to significantly change individuals’ lives for the better, especially young people.</p>\n<p>“You see a lot of growth, you see a lot of confidence building, and some people are just very different people today than when they came in,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>UCSB students are encouraged to access Acacia’s services through a referral from C.A.P.S. Students and members of the community can also access Acacia’s services through their <a href=\"https://www.acaciacw.com/isla-vista-appointment\">online registration form.</a></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

He set a MLB record with 16 RBIs in his team’s first four games and was also named AL Player of the Week for his efforts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The man patrolling centerfield for the Orioles hasn’t started off too bad either. His name is Adam Jones and he is an emerging superstar. He is hitting .522 (15-30) with four doubles, one home run and eight RBIs. If the Orioles are going to repeat their success in the AL East from a year ago, they will need to pitch as well as they are hitting.</p>\n<p>Down in Atlanta, the Braves and Justin Upton are flexing their muscles in the NL East. Upton is hitting .423 with eight RBIs and leads the MLB with six home runs.</p>\n<p>The Braves are also getting some great production from their young first baseman Freddie Freeman. Before a trip to the 15-day disabled list for an oblique strain, Freeman was hitting .412 with seven RBIs in only five games. After the retirement of Chipper Jones, Freeman is slowly becoming one of the faces of the franchise.</p>\n<p>Atlanta certainly has the roster to challenge the Washington Nationals from clinching a second consecutive AL East title despite solid performances from youngsters such as Bryce Harper.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to have a better week than Clayton Kershaw had. He went 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA and a minute .44 WHIP. In their first game with the game tied at zero, Kershaw blasted a home run to go along with a complete game shutout. He was named NL Player of the Week and has Dodger fans thinking about a deep playoff run.</p>\n<p>Overall, Kershaw has led a dominant Dodgers pitching staff that has allowed a mere six runs in six games, good for a 1.00 ERA, by far tops in the majors. Whether or not the rest of the lineup can support the pitching staff with run support is another question.</p>\n<p>After a disappointing season last year, the Red Sox have put that all behind them. Clay Buchholz and Jon Lester are dominating on the mound. They have combined for three wins and have allowed only three earned runs.</p>\n<p>Their young third baseman Will Middlebrooks, is turning into a star. On Sunday, Middlebrooks hit three home runs and flied out to the warning track in his final at-bat.</p>\n<p>In an AL East that has no clear cut front-runner, Boston may be able to put together enough wins for a division title despite the firesale they displayed during last season’s trade deadline. Look for these players to put up some monster seasons and hopefully avoid the injury bug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 9, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/","id":2116,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[2115,2114,2113],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
