Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed 12 questions, created prior to the debate by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the rest of the highlights from Monday’s presidential debate:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>COMMUNITY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Asked to define “community,” Nemeh gave a simple answer: “Isla Vista.” Nemeh said the university, police and Santa Barbara County have not prioritized student needs in their decisions concerning Isla Vista, which he said he hopes to address as president. Le said community is “being a Gaucho,” and he added that he plans to increase career planning services and expand the alumni recruitment network.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>POLICE PRESENCE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they felt police presence made the campus safer, to which Nemeh responded, “No.” Nemeh said the campus needs to “reevaluate our relationship with police,” citing an incident in February where a female skateboarder was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-14/detained-skateboarder-faces-resisting-arrest-charges/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forcibly detained</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Arbor after she attempted to flee from receiving a ticket. Nemeh advocated instead for  what he called “community-based policing.” Le said Nemeh “highlighted the cons” of campus police presence, but he wanted to “highlight the pros.” He said the police departments have made progress in “demilitarizing” their officers, and he cited the “substantial decrease” in the number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/deltopia-crowds-up-arrests-down-from-last-year/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrests at Deltopia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this year.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>QUALIFICATIONS</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Nemeh said the attribute that uniquely qualifies him for president is his “pre-existing understanding” of A.S., having worked with the student government for the past three years. Le said his qualifying attribute is his “leadership capabilities,” and as president he said he wants to implement a “bottom-up” approach. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When asked how he has been an advocate for marginalized communities, Le cited his lobbying experience. He said he wants to empower students of marginalized communities rather than the “top-down” approach of advocating for them In response to the same question, Nemeh cited his work toward implementing the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-26/a-s-senators-explain-new-voting-system-for-spring-senate-elections/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single Transferrable Vote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which he said makes voting more “equitable” in A.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>STUDENT FEES: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first audience question of the day asked the candidates what they will do to ensure fiscal responsibility in light of the fact that UCSB students pay the highest student fees in the UC. Le said he plans to start a program for students to run their own businesses, which he said will create an alternate revenue source for A.S. Nemeh said A.S. needs to prioritize on eliminating tuition rather than reducing student fees.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS + LOCAL:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates if they view the position of A.S. president only working on campus issues. Nemeh said the Isla Vista Party wants to work directly with the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) and alongside the student governments of other UC campuses. Le said the president needs to help be present in statewide affairs and in making sure that President Donald Trump does not “encroach on our campus.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The next audience question asked the candidates if they had ever worked with UCSB Undocumented Student Services. Nemeh said he has “not directly” worked with the program, but he hopes to pick a qualified undocumented students services coordinator to work in the Office of the A.S. President. Le cited his experience lobbying to make California a “sanctuary state” and working alongside state legislators to push such legislation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CAMPUS CLIMATE:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another audience question asked the candidate to give their thoughts on campus climate in regard to a recent visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/ben-shapiro-packs-campbell-hall-for-controversial-lecture/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a cancelled visit from </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-11/milo-yiannopoulos-visit-canceled-at-uc-santa-barbara/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milo Yiannopoulos</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Le said he supports freedom of speech “so long that these speakers abide by university conduct and they do not incite harm.” Le also mentioned how he was once a registered Republican in high school and has since switched party affiliations. Nemeh said he does not tolerate “students coming out and attacking other students for their identities,” citing the violence that erupted from Yiannopoulos’s visit to Berkeley in February. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEADERSHIP:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked what is the most important quality of a leader, Le said a leader must be able to listen to the issues of students on campus. Doerr did not pose the same question to Nemeh.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>SPECIAL PROJECTS:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doerr asked each candidate if they planned to undertake any special projects should either of them become president. Nemeh mentioned again the “$48 fix,” but he also said he wants to implement an open-source textbook library. Le cited again his work to eliminate student tuition through the state legislature.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>LEGACY:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Asked about the legacy they would want to leave, Le answered that it is not about leaving a legacy but rather about setting up a foundation for future student leaders. “Coming in with the mindset that we have to do everything in one year is not practical and feasible,” he said. Nemeh said he would like to strengthen communication between A.S. and university administration so that everyone is not “trying to reinvent the wheel from the beginning.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>ANTI-SEMITISM:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The last audience question of the day asked the candidates how they plan to address the anti-Semitism on campus that may result from the Israel-Palestine conflict. Le said the campus needs to facilitate “ a civil discourse between Muslim groups on campus and the Jewish organizations.” Nemeh disagreed with Le, saying the Israel-Palestine conflict is not a Muslim-Jewish conflict. “Students who have disagreements with each other on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have it because of political disagreements, not religious ones,” he said.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>FREEDOM OF SPEECH:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doerr asked the candidates to give their stance on the abilities and rights of students to protest. Both candidates said it is a constitutionally protected right. Nemeh said he is a strong supporter of demonstration, which he said helps to produce “new forms of knowledge.” Le said students should be able to express themselves freely and the campus should not be censoring any viewpoints.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>PRIVILEGE: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked “what does privilege mean to you,” Nemeh recalled being able to move safely back to the U.S. from Syria at the start of the Syrian Civil War. Le recalled being the son of a Vietnamese refugee and the first in his family to attend a university.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>FUN FACT: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le also shared a “fun fact” that he was “born on the 4th of July.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In each of their closing remarks, both candidates said again that they want to focus on reducing the costs of attending university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. Elections began 8 p.m. Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of Apr. 27.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-presidential-debate-le-vs-nemeh/","id":2412,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2411,2410,2409],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz","biography":"Not available","articles":[2355,2371,2376,2377,2406,2411,2412,2418,2420,2422,2427,2435,2450,2451,2459,2498,2505,2509,2556,2577,2605,2624,2691,2696,2713,2716,2717,2742,2771,2848,2858,2874,2907,2941,2951,3440,3458,3600,3602,3629,3742,3743,3747,3864,3904,3953,3956,4139,4421,4428,4447,4459,4480,4484,4490,4500,4507,4508,4509,4575,4587,4589,4598,4603,4618,4621,4627,4628,4632,4641,4646,4648,4651,4653,4661,4663,4675,4705,4745,4765,4773,4778,4815],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

She currently serves as an on-campus senator.</p>\n<p>The first to deliver opening remarks, Silva said she was inspired to run for the position after seeing the work of other students on Senate.</p>\n<p>“I feel that students are always historically underrated — especially under the administration — on the state level and national level,” she said. “We really need to tap into the potential, and as a candidate, I feel like that would really be a great role of mine.”</p>\n<p>Sandhu, in her opening remarks, said she decided to run for office after learning from her friends of the different ways that UCSB can improve.</p>\n<p>“I see so much potential in this school, and that’s why I want to continue running with the association,” she said. “I know there are so many changes I could make here that would positively impact students and the campus.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77048\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77048\" data-attachment-id=\"77048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-internal-vice-presidential-candidate-forum-sandhu-vs-silva/fullsizerender1-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1806&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1806\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender(1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?fit=250%2C220&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?fit=888%2C783&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-77048\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1-1024x903.jpg?resize=888%2C783\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"783\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?resize=1024%2C903&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?resize=250%2C220&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?resize=768%2C677&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jasmine Sandhu, the Campus United candidate for internal vice president, said she has been serving in student government since fifth grade<em>. Josh Ortiz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andy Doerr, manager of the A.S. Media Center, moderated the forum. He posed six questions, formed by the A.S. Elections Board, and gave the candidates one minute each to answer. Doerr also relayed questions asked anonymously by audience members.</p>\n<p>Here are the highlights of Monday’s IVP candidate forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When asked about the largest problem with A.S., Sandhu cited what she called the “inability” of new senators to become comfortable and accustomed to their new position. Silva, meanwhile, said A.S. should “step up on accountability by making the association more public” and increase transparency with the work on-campus senators participate in.</li>\n<li>Both candidates listed passion as an important quality to have as an IVP. “Those with passion can dedicate themselves to the job can do it well effectively and efficiently,” Sandhu said.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would preserve a civil environment in Senate, Silva said she would make the senators “feel validated” for their work. Sandhu said she would “empower” senators to serve their constituents.</li>\n<li>When asked how they would train new senators, Sandhu said she would “revamp” senator training in the summer and focus on building strong connections with Boards and Commissions. Silva said she wants outgoing senators to train incoming senators through “informative workshops.”</li>\n<li>In terms of the connections that each candidate had for both student leaders and administrators around campus, Silva cited her working relationships with administrative officials like Assistant Director for Government Affairs LaDonte King, Executive Director Marisela Marquez and her history with student groups like the Black Student Union. Sandhu emphasized on the importance of maintaining these relationships and said she was “fortunate to have connected with different students on campus.”</li>\n<li>An audience member asked the candidates how familiar they are with the internal workings of an organization. Sandhu said she was the class president through fifth grade and high school and served as a senator this year. Silva said she has been “privileged” to have mentors within the association and understands the different perspectives of members of the association through their work on the budget.</li>\n<li>In her closing remarks, Silva said she is grateful for the opportunity to run for office and for those who have supported her. Sandhu said she loves UCSB and wants all students to have a positive experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. Elections began 8 p.m. Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of Apr. 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77045\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-internal-vice-presidential-candidate-forum-sandhu-vs-silva/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77045\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-internal-vice-presidential-candidate-forum-sandhu-vs-silva/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-internal-vice-presidential-candidate-forum-sandhu-vs-silva/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-internal-vice-presidential-candidate-forum-sandhu-vs-silva/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/a-s-internal-vice-presidential-candidate-forum-sandhu-vs-silva/","id":2411,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2410,2409,2408],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Meeting Focuses on Displaced Students, Deltopia","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Student-Fees-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Student-Fees-by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Associated Students (A.S.)

Tenants Union (IVTU) spoke during the open forum about students displaced from Del Playa due to the cliff erosion. They have created a $15,000 emergency fund and asked Senate to match these funds to ensure that students have access to new housing, financial support, moving support and legal assistance.</p>\n<p>Senate voted to pass a resolution to match this funding, giving up to $300 per displaced UCSB student. SBCC students will not be eligible.</p>\n<p>IVTU is also creating an emergency protocol to ensure that students’ needs are met and that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Senate also approved a resolution on the “festival ordinance” in relation to Deltopia, changing the dates of the ordinance to include April 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The bill also aims to increase the role of the external vice president of local affairs in the discussion of the ordinance and open communication between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>They also voted on a resolution regarding advertisements aired on social media discouraging students from coming to I.V. to attend Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Senator Cole Marting expressed concern about a lack of public data about the effectiveness of the advertising and added a stipulation to the resolution asking that the university provide Senate with data.</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with 19 senators in support. Senator Ashley Selki abstained.</p>\n<p>As for items discussed, the meeting began with a statement from Gina Fischer, a representative for Third District County Supervisor Joan Hartmann, about the installation of traffic light at the intersection of Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Norte.</p>\n<p>Senator Batsheva Stoll expressed concern over the 10 minute intervals between classes when students rush through Pardall, and whether timing on the street lights might affect this.</p>\n<p>“We watch it and make minor tweaks to it to make it run as efficiently as possible,” Scott McGolpin, Santa Barbara public works director, said.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed law enforcement at the stoplight.</p>\n<p>Stoll said “people will be angry with a $200 traffic ticket,” but Deputy James McKarrell said there would first be an educational period ensuring that students understand proper safety, followed by a probationary period with heavy police presence to give out warnings to students who did not obey the light.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t see a change, then we will have an enforcement period,” McKarrell said. “My job is not to necessarily be out here and have you like me; it’s to make sure you get home to your parents.”</p>\n<p>There was also a discussion regarding anti-Semitism that was discussed during the last Senate meeting, with Jack Tannenbaum, third-year economics major, expressing extreme disapproval of the way Senate handled a discussion about anti-Semitism during last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s a right of any minority group to define what hate against themselves is,” he said. “It’s extremely inappropriate to diminish harm students are feeling because it’s late at night.”</p>\n<p>Senators all expressed their support. Senator Marting said he had taken the time to fully understand anti-Semitism, and Natalie Jordan said they would consider doing more trainings to help further understanding.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with a statement by Steven Kwok, director of legislative accountability, expressing his disappointment in the lack of engagement by senators with BCUs.</p>\n<p>“I do want to stress how important your presence at meetings is,” he said. “There are a lot of people doing work out there, and I’m not sure how much you know about it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 23, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

The university is in the process of hiring more student and full-time employees to accommodate the increase in the dining commons’ capacity.</p>\n<p>The Portola Dining Commons will be supplied with specialized cooking equipment, including a tandoori oven, rotisserie oven and tortilla machine in the bakery.</p>\n<p>Students will also be able to see their food prepared through the six open kitchens, said Carin Whitney, spokesperson from KieranTimberlake, adding that the cooking and serving areas of the dining commons are “integral” to its overall design.</p>\n<p>“The culinary experience is architectural,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p>Whitney said the university and architecture team considered the dining commons’ environmental effects in its design and operation, including energy-efficient cooking equipment, sustainable food service practices and a solar hot water system for washing dishes.</p>\n<p>“The team expects high performance benchmarks once [the] building opens for service,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>Update: The cost of the Portola Dining Commons’ construction was unavailable at the time of publication and has since been added to the article. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
