If I will boycott Israel tomorrow morning, how can I survive? Will BDS find me a job? Will BDS feed my children?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporters of BDS and members of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) have criticized Eid’s stance. Audience members called him a “traitor” in February at the University of Chicago, and just days before his UCSB event, SJP and the Muslim Students Association at Cal State Long Beach protested his lecture there. At UCSB, campus security was present, but the event proceeded without incident. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kayla Shenassa, a second-year classics major, organized Eid’s lecture without the aid of any student organization by contacting the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), the agency overseeing his tour, after noticing Eid was speaking at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p> If I will boycott Israel tomorrow morning, how can I survive? Will BDS find me a job? Will BDS feed my children?” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important for our community and students on either side, or on no side, of this issue to hear the truth, and Bassem is one of the biggest sources of truth on this issue because of his background as a Palestinian human rights activist,” Shenassa said. “The reality is that BDS is not conducive to peace whether it’s on campus or in the Middle East.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to denouncing BDS, Eid spoke on topics ranging from his arrest by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 1996 to the corruption of Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid maintains that the only solution to the plight of Palestinians must be one that improves the economic standing of his people. He said over 92,000 Palestinian workers currently hold Israeli work permits and enter Israel to work for the companies BDS seeks to divest from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He pointed at the closure of a SodaStream factory that BDS successfully forced to move out of the West Bank as a disaster for 1,500 Palestinian workers who lost jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians living in the West Bank are not worried about settlements,” Eid said. “They are worried about having a job and how they will feed their families.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the plight of Gaza, Eid said he places most of the responsibility on Hamas, the ruling government there, which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization and Eid calls a “dictatorship.”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves.” — Baseem Eid</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want BDS to come to the leaders of Hamas by asking why the leadership imposed three wars on the Gaza strip,” Eid said. “I think the survival of the Gazan people is the responsibility of the Hamas organization.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eid gave individual messages for SJP members and BDS advocates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To SJP, my message is one message: The only ones who will succeed to bring justice to the Palestinians will be the Palestinians themselves,” Eid said. “To the BDS, I have to say you are killing our economy. You are destroying our economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SJP representatives who attended the lecture declined to comment.</span></p>\n<p>When asked what BDS supporters can do to help the Palestinian people, Eid suggested investing rather than divesting.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the BDS will succeed to persuade Palestinian billionaires who are living abroad to invest in Gaza and the West Bank, I will look at that as a huge help,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleta resident Andriana Goodell said she came to learn from someone with “relevant experience” of the conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw it advertised in my community center and thought it was interesting that Eid lived for 33 years in Shuafat,” Goodell said. “I learned good information from a person with relevant experience toward the Palestinian and Israeli conflict.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eidan Shalom, a third-year psychology major, served in the Israeli Defense Forces from 2011 to 2013 and is the president and founder of Students Supporting Israel at UCSB. Although he disagreed with Eid’s call to open up Israel’s borders, he agreed with Eid’s views on BDS.</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Palestinians need economic prosperity,” Shalom said. “When BDS thinks they are targeting Israel, in reality they are targeting Israeli businesses, which actually employ thousands of Palestinians.”</span></p>\n<p><em>[Correction: In an earlier version of this article, Mahmoud Abbas was referenced as the President of the State of Palestine.

<em>Photo courtesy of news.ucsb.edu</em></p></div>\n<p>Professor of Physics and Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics member Joe Polchinksi gave the annual Faculty Research Lecture Thursday night after being selected as the Faculty Research Lecturer in May, an honor that recognizes extraordinary scholarly distinction and contribution to the campus and community.</p>\n<p>Polchinski has received a number of awards for his contributions to fundamental physics, including the Physics Frontiers Prize from the Milner Foundation, which was given for his work involving quantum field theory and string theory, as well as the discovery of D-branes, structures that have been shown to provide the atomic structure of black holes. Polchinski’s lecture explored black holes and spoke of the search for a unified theory of the laws of physics along with the difficulty of connecting two main theories — quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>\n<p>Polchinski’s research focuses especially on quantum field theory, which is the basic mathematical language of particle physics. It also focuses on string theory, a proposed unified theory of all the laws of physics in which all particles are tiny vibrating strings.</p>\n<p>“In quantum field theory, I have clarified some of the important ideas, by explaining how they follow from simple principles,” Polchinski said in an email. “In string theory, I am best known for showing that the theory could not be complete, that besides strings it requires other objects that we call branes. I also have proposed an explanation of the dark energy discovered by astronomers.”</p>\n<p>According to Polchinski, his research has been aided by his ability to comprehend both the concepts of physics and the mathematics that accompany his form of research.</p>\n<p>“Probably most of my discoveries have come by taking some interesting mathematical result in physics, and understanding what is the physical principle that explains it,” Polchinski said in an email. “I think my best tool is the ability to translate back and forth between equations and physics.”</p>\n<p>Polchinski said thought experiments with black holes have led to some surprising discoveries: black hole bits, the holographic principle and Maldacena’s duality. He also said he hopes his new thought experiments will result in greater theoretical understanding of quantum gravity.</p>\n<p>“The latest thought experiment presents new challenges, and we can hope that it will lead us to a more complete theory of quantum gravity,” Polchinski said.</p>\n<p>Polchinski’s contributions to theoretical physics include a modern formulation of renormalization theory and original work on the string landscape. Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Polchinski is exceptional both for his scientific achievements and for his ability to simplify concepts for a broader audience.</p>\n<p>“As one of the pioneers of string theory, he has demonstrated tremendous creativity and insight, not only in discovering new scientific truths, but also in communicating these complex ideas in a highly accessible and inspiring way,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Washington State University alumnae Wanda Johnsen attended Polchinski’s lecture and said she was inspired by how Polchinski reinstated the idea that there are still many things to discover and that there are no limitations to the universe.</p>\n<p>“The lecture gave some answers about the infinity of the universe,” said Johnsen. “Who knows what is the beginning, where is the end, and how all universes are expanding. It brings a new idea about the lack of limitations.”</p>\n<p>Polchinkski said that while new discoveries have been made in the field of physics, there is still much more to learn.</p>\n<p>“I hope they got the idea that there are some big questions about the nature of space and other things, that we have some new and exciting ideas about,” Polchinski said.</p>\n<p>According to Professor emeritus of mathematics Eugene Johnsen, the lecture provided any member of the audience who is interested in science a basic understanding of Polchinski’s complex research.</p>\n<p>“One of the best things I took away from tonight was some of the connections between quantum mechanics, general relativity, special relativity and all of the issues that came up within that topic: the paradoxes, the questions and the present state of affairs,” Johnsen said. “[His lecture] will motivate future scientists and future physicists to pursue this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Rob Romero and five others again prepared for the 100-mile drive to Los Angeles, arriving later that morning.</p>\n<p>Because of the uneasiness on campus, UCPD officers provided security for several events that would not usually require a police presence, Romero said. They also responded to emergency calls, freeing up UCLA officers who Romero said “are really wrapped up in the investigation” of the gunman.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to show the community at UCLA that you’re safe,” Romero said by phone from UCLA on Thursday. “We’re here to listen, to give hugs, sometimes just to talk to people about what happened.”</p>\n<p>The UCPD officers returned to UCSB late Friday night, but are “ready to redeploy if needed,” Romero said in an email.</p>\n<p>In addition to assisting at UCLA, university police are increasing their presence at UCSB as well.</p>\n<p>“I also

a little bit safer,” she said. “If anybody’s thinking about messing with anything, we’re here.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the increase in police, UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has updated its <a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> with resources and is ready for students who seek help following the UCLA shooting.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t seen any notable increase right now, but we’ll have to see over the coming days,” Dr. Janet Osimo, a psychologist at CAPS, said.</p>\n<p>“It’s not uncommon for this kind of thing to reactivate people who were here during the Isla Vista tragedy,” Osimo said, referring to the 2014 shooting that left six UCSB students dead. “They might not be feeling safe and be scared and uncertain … that’s a pretty common response.”</p>\n<p>Osimo said people should take special care to get adequate rest, eat well, and give themselves “permission to feel different, because that’s a really common reaction.”</p>\n<p>On Twitter, many students from UC schools showed support for UCLA students by using the hashtag, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/weareoneuc\" target=\"_blank\">#WeAreOneUC</a>, which also surfaced on Twitter after the Isla Vista shooting in 2014.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

classes to immerse themselves in creative alternatives.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind the hiatus is Laurel Beckman, professor of art, who says the event is intended to create a “communal environment” within the art department. Alaia/Paipo surfboard making, silk scarf dyeing and a trip to the Getty Center Museum in L.A. are among the activities planned this week to replace the regular humdrum of university life.</p>\n<p>Beckman said the idea for the interlude came together quickly because of cooperation from faculty and students. Students are “agents of their own interests,” Beckman said, explaining that they will be leading several of the week’s activities.</p>\n<p>“One of the really important parts of the interlude is that everybody’s participating: students, staff, faculty, grad students, undergrads, everybody,” Beckman said. “Other than classes and working by yourself in the studio, we don’t have a lot of community activities, and I wanted to do [an interlude] so people could choose … what they participated in.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69768\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69768\" data-attachment-id=\"69768\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/arts-building-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Arts Building\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69768\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arts-Building_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Kip Fulbeck, professor of art, said recently that students had not been producing with the same “drive and fervor” that he is used to, and the arts faculty had also become complacent.</p>\n<p>“We were becoming stagnant and needed to shake things up,” Fulbeck said in an email. “I’m hoping to re-ignite our creative drives, excitement, passion for making art and experiencing life. You learn more outside the classroom than in it.”</p>\n<p>Graduate students found out about the interlude late last quarter and were highly encouraged to direct activities or to create ideas for alternative classes.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Rose Briccetti, who has organized a butterfly pinning event, said the interlude will be an interesting outlet for creativity.</p>\n<p>“[The interlude] seemed like a fun kind of unique way to get people thinking about art outside the confines of just painting or printmaking or sculpture or the materials and ways of making we kind of generally adhere to,” Briccetti said.</p>\n<p>According to graduate student Emily Baker, the arts department is lacking a critical element of preparation for a career in arts: a tight-knit community. Baker said she pushes students to go to art events every quarter so they can talk about their work and have contacts to “bounce ideas off of.”</p>\n<p>“As an artist, networking is my work. It’s my job, you know? Like the whole ‘wine and cheese’ art event thing, that’s work,” Baker said. “And I did feel that lack of community in the arts department … so I think this will help perpetuate that community a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Students and professors alike are unsure at the moment whether they will carry the interlude into the future, but at least a few, like Briccetti, are very interested in seeing it continue as a department tradition. Taking a risk is difficult in huge institutions, Briccetti said, commenting that university rules and protocols can limit activities that are “strange and different and out of the box.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think you can have innovation, or you know, society can’t move forward if people aren’t willing to just try something new,” Briccetti said. “So I hope that this — regardless of how it all shakes out — is something that will inspire other departments and our department to shake things up, to try new things, to not get stuck in old ways of doing things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69795\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69795\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-arts-department-takes-interlude-to-build-community-expand-creativity/","id":2502,"author":{"id":121,"name":"Dakota Maxwell"},"related":[2501,2500,2499],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
