The team was even able to grab two victories on the road, which it hadn’t done all season. This recent success of the Gauchos was enough to push them up to No. 60 in National ITA rankings.</p>\n<p>Today the team will be looking for its first conference win of the season as they played one early match at the beginning of February on the road in Irvine. Despite leading for a fraction of the match, Santa Barbara could not hold off UCI and fell 3-4 to the Anteaters. Including today’s match with the Rainbow Warriors, UCSB will have four more conference matches to push for the title. The Gauchos will have a helpful advantage in playing three of those matches at home, where they are an undefeated 5-0.</p>\n<p>“It’s the familiarity and being comfortable, as well as having your fans coming to support you that makes playing at home so special,” Mays said. “I really feed off of the energy of the crowd, and I think we all do in our own way, so it’s great to have them out there.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos found much of their recent success thanks to their top player from last season, senior Ziad Sultan, returning to singles play for the first time this season in their last road trip. Sultan eased his way into the lineup playing in just doubles matches at first and then finally retaking his spot in the number one court. With Sultan back at the one spot, the Gauchos are given talented depth with senior Tobias Galskov, junior Nathan Eshmade and Mays taking the next three spots for the team. All four players have played phenomenally throughout the season and have moved around throughout the four spots every week.</p>\n<p>Along with Sultan, sophomore Erik Johnsson has grabbed himself a spot in the starting lineup and has not made Head Coach Marty Davis regret that decision, as he is still undefeated in singles play. Johnsson has moved between both the fifth and sixth spots and has always found a way to achieve success after just breaking into this lineup at the beginning of March.</p>\n<p>“Ziad is the leader of this team, so it is inspiring to see him back in the lineup and Erik has not lost a singles match yet,” Mays said. “So we are all really excited to finish the season because we have some great opportunities ahead to finish strong.”</p>\n<p>Today’s match is set for 2 p.m. at the Rec Cen Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-01/mens-tennis-seeks-first-conference-win/","id":148,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[147,146,145],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles","biography":"Not available","articles":[78,81,85,86,101,103,108,110,111,113,115,116,120,122,125,127,129,130,132,140,141,142,145,148,151,156,160,161,165,180,181,448,523,584,627,924,925,927,957,958,960,978,980,1008,1010,1011,1012,1015,1026,1027,1030,1031,1036,1047,1049,1050,1073,1082,1084,1089,1766,1770,1771,1987,1989,1997,2019,2026,2027,2034,3288,3297],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Take Down Hawaii in Conference Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB began a stretch of four consecutive Big West matches by easily defeating Hawaii","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61937\" style=\"width: 317px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_09-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"960956785\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61934\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61937\" data-attachment-id=\"61937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/andrew-riminton-saves-a-ball-at-the-net-sam-aragondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_09-web.jpg?fit=1060%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1060,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Andrew Riminton saves a ball at the net.

Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson were the first to finish as they defeated their opponents 6-1 on the number one court. Sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton were the next to finish and took a one-sided victory as well at 6-2. This gave the Gauchos a 1-0 advantage heading into singles play.</p>\n<p>In singles play, freshman Cody Rakela continued his undefeated home streak taking the win in straight sets of 6-1, 6-1. Rakela is now 6-0 when playing at home, and his victory put the team up 2-0 on court four with five more matches to be played.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Teague Hamilton was the next to finish, playing on the sixth-ranked court. He, too, earned a victory in straight sets by scores of 6-3 and 6-4, which put UCSB up 3-0 and just one match away from sealing the victory.</p>\n<p>“The top of our lineup has been playing so much better recently, and this team is extremely deep this year,” Hamilton said. “Nathan has been playing amazing, Cody hasn’t lost a match and Morgan has been playing really well, too. All of our spots are really solid.”</p>\n<p>The players Hamilton spoke highly of did not disappoint, as they all were able to grab victories. Hawaii was only able to take one match away from the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Eshmade sealed the victory on court two to give the Gauchos a 4-1 victory with more tennis to be played. He defeated his opponent in straight sets of 6-3, 6-3 to continue his successful season.</p>\n<p>Mays and Johnsson took straight set victories as well to finish off the match and give the Gauchos a 6-1 victory. Since coming up to a starting position in early March, Johnsson has won every singles match and has helped the team to many doubles wins.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will prepare for the weekend ahead of them with matches on Saturday and Sunday. They will host both New Mexico State Saturday and conference opponent UC Riverside Sunday to conclude this home stand.</p>\n<p>“I am very confident about this weekend,” Hamilton said. “It won’t be a walk in the park, but it’s a good opportunity to extend our home streak and conference record.”</p>\n<p>The New Mexico match begins at 1 p.m. and the UC Riverside match starts at 10 a.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 15 of April 2, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/gauchos-take-down-hawaii-in-conference-home-opener/","id":145,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[144,143,142],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"March Is Here!

Graduate transfer forward Leland King II bounced back from a combined nine points against Davis and Irvine with a 25-point, 12-rebound performance against CSUN, and his continued production will be essential to the Gauchos’ success.</p>\n<p>Equally important to offensive production, of course, is defensive performance. In Pasternack’s eyes, the two are directly tied together, as defensive success directly feeds offensive success.</p>\n<p>“This week, our complete focus is being able to defend and rebound for 40 minutes,” Pasternack said. “When we do that, our offense will take care of itself. When the ball is coming out of the net, we don’t get fast break points. When we can get stops and run, that’s when we’re at our best.”</p>\n<p>The return of senior forward Jalen Canty will likely be a big help in both the defensive and offensive departments. Canty missed the last six games due to a suspension for violating team rules, but will return on Thursday night against Long Beach, giving UCSB some sorely needed shot-blocking and offensive diversity.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State will enter the Thunderdome as losers of its last three games and in a tie for fifth place in the Big West at 7-7. The Beach has struggled to get stops in each of their last three games, surrendering at least 70 points in all of them and 80 points twice.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81650\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"16742538\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81674\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81650\" data-attachment-id=\"81650\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/mbball_vsucd-180217-dustinharris-11-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-81650\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81650\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After seeing an opening, Marcus Jackson heads for the hoop. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The story offensively for Long Beach State is the same as it was when UCSB traveled to the Walter Pyramid a few weeks ago: senior forward Gabe Levin is the one to stop. Levin is leading the Big West in conference scoring per game, but he doesn’t have another teammate in the top 20.</p>\n<p>After Long Beach State on Thursday, the Gauchos will take on Cal Poly in the Thunderdome on Saturday for Senior Night. The Mustangs have just four wins in Big West play this season, but one of those came at UCSB’s expense all the way back on Jan. 4, so Saturday’s Blue-Green Rivalry matchup has the added motivation of a revenge game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As UCSB’s last game before the Big West Tournament, the matchup against Cal Poly will also be an important tune-up for the team. Working Canty back into the lineup and continuing to rehabilitate the offense will both take time, something the Gauchos won’t have much of once the tournament starts.</p>\n<p>As evidenced by their 9-19 overall record and 4-10 mark in conference play, the Mustangs have had a rough go of things this season. That Jan. 4 win over UCSB, secured with three last-second free throws, may have been the high point of Cal Poly’s season.</p>\n<p>All the same, the Gauchos can’t afford to overlook the Mustangs, as tempting as it might be with the Big West Tournament in sight. Guards Victor Joseph and Donovan Fields hurt UCSB the first time around and are coming off of strong games against CSUN.</p>\n<p>Joseph is sixth in the Big West in points per game in conference play with 15.8 and has knocked down 40.9 of his three-point attempts against conference opponents. The senior guard dropped 36 points in the Mustangs’ double-overtime win over the Marauders, and will test the Gauchos’ ability to provide 40 minutes of solid defense.</p>\n<p>A sweep of this week would give UCSB a home record of 13-1 for the year, its best since at least the 1980-81 season. Two strong games by King and Max Heidegger would also likely push the pair into third place on the list of all time UCSB scoring duos, as they currently sit just 41 points behind Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent, who combined for 1,042 points in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot on the line for the Gauchos this week, but most important is the first-place slot in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Two wins guarantee UCSB at least a half-share of the regular season crown, an incredible turnaround for a team that finished in dead last at 4-12 last season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host Long Beach State on Thursday night at 8 p.m. in an ESPNU-televised matchup, and then close their season in the Thunderdome against Cal Poly on Saturday at 7 p.m. for Senior Night.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 1</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81674\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81674\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/","id":146,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[145,144,143],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB Strikes Gold Against 49ers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team earned its first Big West series win in five tries this weekend at Campus Diamond, sweeping a Long Beach State team in rebuilding mode that not only marked the Gauchos’ (13-33...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB softball team earned its first Big West series win in five tries this weekend at Campus Diamond, sweeping a Long Beach State team in rebuilding mode that not only marked the Gauchos’ (13-33 overall, 4-11 in Big West) first series victory at all this year, but their longest winning streak at three games.

LBSU jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead after its first two turns at bat, but the Gauchos were able to equalize in the bottom of the second after sophomore outfielder Amanda Ziegler launched a two-run bomb to left with one out. It was the younger of the Ziegler sisters’ first home run and RBI of the year after she posted four homers and 28 RBI during her freshman campaign.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[The Ziegler home run] was awesome,” Beristianos said. “It’s always great to see an underclassman come through in situations like that. I was very happy for her.”<br>\nBoth sides went scoreless through the third, fourth and half of the fifth until UCSB broke the game wide open in the fifth’s later half. With two on and two out, freshman infielder Keilani</p>\n<p>Jennings lifted a three-run shot to right — her fourth of the year — to put Santa Barbara up 5-2. No runs would be scored for the game’s remainder, leaving the Gauchos with a win which was not only their second win in 18 games, but the first time they had put up five runs or more since March 26. Cobb was credited with the win after giving up only two runs on seven hits while fanning five.</p>\n<p>“We just did the little things,” Beristianos said. “We got runners on base, moved runners and got bunts down. We put the ball in play and made the defense play.”</p>\n<p>The second game featured a pitcher’s duel between Cobb and fellow sophomore ace Taylor Petty, with no runs being scored outside of the third inning. In that deciding frame, it was Cobb who blinked first, hitting the first batter she faced which eventually led to that runner scoring on a single by senior outfielder Ashley Weber. Cobb allowed no more Long Beach runs for the game after that. UCSB answered its next turn at bat with two consecutive RBI singles from senior infielder Jessica Ziegler and sophomore outfielder Brooke Putich, putting UCSB up 2-1. Petty left the game in the fourth in favor of junior Brooke Turner, who proceeded to leave the Gauchos hitless for the rest of the game. Cobb was equal to the task, and earned her fifth win of the year after giving up only one run on seven hits.</p>\n<p>Despite having its first conference series victory of the year assured, UCSB again placed Cobb on the mound to face Turner after the Gaucho sophomore had already pitched 14 innings the day before. In a pitcher’s duel worthy of remembrance, Cobb and Turner continued to trade scoreless innings until the end of regulation and still the scoreboard read 0-0. Having now pitched 21 consecutive innings, conventional wisdom would dictate pulling Cobb in favor of either senior MeLinda Matsumoto or Lindsey Correa, but the team stood by their ace and in return, their ace did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>“We definitely wanted to keep her in,” Beristianos said. “She was keeping [Long Beach] off-guard, doing so well out there we just wanted to stay until she ran out of gas.”</p>\n<p>Cobb pitched two more scoreless innings until finally in the bottom of the tenth, the Santa Barbara offense broke though Turner. Sophomore outfielder Jamie Adishian began the inning with a single, then advanced to second on a sacrifice by Jessica Ziegler. Putich grounded one straight to the pitcher in the next at bat, but reached first safely as Turner tried unsuccessfully to throw out Adishian running to third. With runners on the corners and one out, all UCSB needed was a deep sacrifice to win, and Beristianos obliged them. Beristianos sent one high to center field for the sacrifice RBI, which scored Adishian from third and completed the Gauchos’ first sweep of Long Beach since 2001. For her part, Cobb earned her third win in a row, equaling the number of wins this weekend that she had in her previous 15 starts, while holding LBSU scoreless on six hits Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We had fought and fought and fought, and we just hadn’t gotten our breaks, so we were ready to battle and keep on fighting,” Beristianos said. “To get the results that we did [this weekend] was awesome.”</p>\n<p>UCSB completes its 2010 home schedule next weekend when it hosts a three-game set with Pacific, with games on Saturday and Sunday at noon, 2 p.m. and noon respectively. As always, admission for students is free.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21620\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21620\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/","id":147,"author":{"id":302,"name":"Miles Yim"},"related":[146,145,144],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
