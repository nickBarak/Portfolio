He is 16-5 overall this season, holds a dual match record of 11-4 and has won seven of his last 10 matches. Joined by sophomore Ruben Alberts, Amilon also plays on court one in doubles for Las Vegas and holds a dual match record of 8-4. The junior player will likely matchup with Santa Barbara’s Eshmade in both the singles and doubles round.</p>\n<p>UNLV will have one home match with Air Force on Friday afternoon before making the trip to California.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside will face the Gauchos on Sunday after hosting Cal Poly the previous afternoon. The Highlanders currently sit on a one-match losing streak after dropping a 7-0 outing to UC Davis. Before falling to the Aggies, Riverside had won two straight, defeating both Hawaii and Middlebury.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders struggle in both singles in doubles play as their records in each are below the .500 mark. The only consistent performances on the team’s roster have come from freshman Kyle McCann, who plays primarily on court three for his squad.</p>\n<p>So far this season McCann holds a dual match record of 14-9 and will likely match up with Santa Barbara’s junior co-captain, Morgan Mays.</p>\n<p>“We really want to win Big West a second straight time, and it starts here,” Eshmade explained. “Our ultimate goal is to get back to the NCAAs, but we just have to take things match by match.”</p>\n<p>The match on Saturday with UNLV is set to start at 2 p.m. at the Rec Cen Courts. The Gauchos will face UCR in Riverside on Sunday at noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

Senior Khalil Ahmad and junior point guard Austen Awosika added to the action with 19 points and 12 points respectively while all three guards had over 4 assists to fuel the Titan attack.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While UCSB scored the first four points in the game, the Titans’ pinpoint shooting and stout defense proved to be too much for the Guachos to handle. Fullerton shot 55.2% on field goals including a monsterous 63% in the first half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a 17-14 lead with 11:51 remaining in the first half after a four-point-play from freshman Jay Nagle, but that’s when the Titans started cooking while SB began to freeze up.</p>\n<p>Through three games, UCSB has focused on stopping one significant playmaker from Cal Poly’s Donovan Fields to Dikymbe Martin on Riverside and TJ Shorts II with UC Davis. Yet, the Titans had three elusive guards to spread the floor and the Gauchos had no answer for it.</p>\n<p>UCSB had a three and a half minute stretch with only two points when sophomore captain point guard Devearl Ramsey was off the floor, but his impact was felt immediately upon his return with seven minutes to play.</p>\n<p>Ramsey grabbed a defensive board and took it coast to coast to cut the Titan lead back to three and on the ensuing possession, the Sierra Canyon product delivered a contested trey to tie it up once again at 26 a piece with 6:22 on the clock.</p>\n<p>Fullerton turned it on at the end of the half to rout the Gauchos with a 22-5 run, 19 of those 22 points came from their three musketeers, who capped off consecutive buzzer beaters on the final two possessions of the half to balloon the lead up to a hefty 17-point deficit. On top 48-31 Fullerton ran into the tunnel at the break with the momentum fully in its control.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos muscled their way back in the second half behind 6 points in two minutes from sophomore forward Robinson Idehen to cut it to 55-42 with 14:06 left to play.</p>\n<p>The comeback felt imminent as UCSB was knocking down shots and getting stops. Devearl ramsey went on a 7-point run by himself to inch closer with 10:44 in the second half as he splashed a triple from the left wing to cut the deficit 9 points with a 59-50 lead for the Titans.</p>\n<p>Ramsey closed in with another three at 6:54 to cut it to seven, but that was the closest the Gauchos would get as Fullerton closed out another half with an assertive 18-4 run behind the final 11 points from Khalil Ahmad to put the nail in the coffin and hand UCSB its first loss since December 19 on the road in Omaha, Neb.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Dedrique Taylor made a crucial defensive adjustment in the second half as three Titans would collapse on the Gaucho ball-handler once they crossed the timeline. The Gauchos had no rebuttal for the Fullerton triple-trap and ultimately fell in the second half.</p>\n<p>While Devearl ramsey had 15 points and Jaquori Mclaughlin added 11 with a career-high 8 rebounds, UCSB struggled from deep, shooting 8-28 from beyond the arc. The team couldn’t finish from the line going 54.5% from the line on 22 tries. The Gauchos allowed 46 points in the paint compared to just 22 that UCSB was able to convert and the open looks for Fullerton attributed to its 55% shooting night.</p>\n<p>Four Titans scored in double-figures including a 12 and 12 double-double from junior forward Jackson Rowe as the Gauchos fell in Titan Gym. Although their overall 7-12 record may not reflect their skill level, Big West foes will be left bruised and burned if they don’t remember the Titans.</p>\n<p>UCSB men’s basketball heads to Long Beach State on Saturday evening for a 7 p.m. tip-off against the 49ers in Walter Pyramid.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Redshirt junior Coco Miller started to find her rhythm as she swished a couple mid-range jumpers which gave the Gauchos some momentum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller came into this game red hot as she had a career high scoring performance with 33 points, with 18 of those points coming from behind the three-point line. Although it was a slow start, she would make a huge impact in the second half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither team could create separation from the other in the third period with both teams seemingly scoring at will. Junior center Natalie Bruening dominated in the post as she used her size to convert easy layups. For LBSU, junior forward Cydnee Kinslow had an outstanding third quarter with two threes as well as a couple of steals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruening has started to find her confidence as of late on the offensive end of the floor as she is attacking the basket aggressively, leading to an increase in free throw attempts. Going forward, it will be crucial that she sustains this level of play because it will force defenses to double her in the paint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were finally able to gain some breathing room as they outscored the 49ers by six points in the final eight minutes to come away with the victory. Danae Miller not only hit a clutch mid-range floater with the shot clock about to expire but iced the game from the free throw line as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the keys behind their victory was their ability to hold the 49ers to 35 percent shooting from the field, which can be attributed to the persistent ball pressure. All five players on the court were communicating on the floor as well which kept LBSU from finding their rhythm offensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another welcoming sight for UCSB was the balanced scoring between Danae Miller, Coco Miller and Bruening who combined for 46 of the team’s total 60 points. This is extremely encouraging for a team that has struggled to find a second scorer to emerge behind Coco Miller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although sophomore guard Bri Anugwom did not make an impact scoring the ball, her contributions on the other end of the floor cannot be overlooked as she grabbed a career high fourteen rebounds in the contest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the Gauchos to build upon this game, they will need to continue to bring maximum defensive effort as they still build chemistry on the offensive end. Moreover, they will need to continue to play team basketball and avoid the ball sticking in one place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will be back in action next week as it faces Cal State Fullerton at home on Thursday Jan. 24 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Then on Saturday, the Gauchos will once again head south toward Long Beach where they’ll face off against the 49ers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering this week of play, the Gauchos find themselves in their best form of the season. Now besting their own five-game win streak from back in November, the Gauchos’ are currently unbeaten in six games and have been perfect through the month of January. At the moment, UCSB is also one of only 27 other collegiate teams in the nation who is unbeaten in conference play. The Gauchos will also be coming off their most recent road win after traveling to and defeating UC Davis by a final score of 69-58.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altogether, the Gauchos currently boast a 14-3 overall record on the season. Notably, those three losses have all come from away games. UCSB still remains undefeated, 9-0, when playing at home in the Thunderdome. The men’s team will look to maintain their winning ways and continue their excellent momentum through this week’s pair of conference games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Fullerton’s campaign hasn’t gone quite as well. The Titans are at a 6-12 overall record on the season and have only won one of their nine away games. When it comes to defending their home court, however, they have done well as they find themselves at a 4-2 home record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans’ have recently been on a small hot-streak of their own. Fullerton has won their last two games, with their most recent victory being a 92-90 overtime win against Long Beach State. Historically speaking, UCSB has faced Cal State Fullerton a total of 86 times, with the Gauchos leading the all-time series at a record of 47-39. The last time these two teams faced each other came in January of last year, where a close fight resulted in a 70-65 Gaucho road win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Saturday’s opponent, Long Beach State’s season has been a bit better. Currently standing at an overall record of 8-11 on the season, the 49ers have shared a similar form of poor play on the road when compared to their ability to play at home. Boasting a 6-2 record whenever they’re the hosts, Long Beach State will pose yet another challenge for the Gauchos come time for tip-off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 49ers’ most recent form has also proven promising, as Long Beach State has won three of four games in the month of January; as they’ll be coming off their most recent, aforementioned, overtime loss to Cal State Fullerton. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of the all-time series against the Gauchos, the 49ers take the advantage in this one with a 76-59 lead over UCSB in the 126 total games they’ve shared. The Gauchos will also look to even the score, considering Long Beach State was also the victor the last time these two sides faced; which resulted in a devastating 69-70 home loss for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, this season has proven much more promising for the Gauchos, as this team full of veteran and young talents continues to shine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players to watch for the Gauchos include graduate guard Ar’mond Davis and freshman forward Jay Nagle. Davis is coming off an impressive 23-point performance in the latest win against UC Davis, also adding eight rebounds and two assists to his total. As for Nagle, he managed eight points from off the bench and a pair of rebounds in his 16 minutes of play.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Titans’ end, the Gauchos should expect a two-pronged offense revolving around senior guards Khalil Ahmad and Kyle Allman Jr. Ahmad and Allman are the only two scorers on their team to have surpassed 300 points on the season, and the dangerous duo has also combined for a total of 54 assists through the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the 49ers, senior guard Deishuan Booker has been lighting up the scoreboard as of late. He leads his team in overall scoring and also in assists, with a total of 78 to his name. This week’s recurring theme will be prolific guards, as the Gauchos will have to game plan against their next opponents’ outstanding backcourt players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A conference standings update is in order, as the Gauchos are currently the only undefeated team in Big West play. Sitting atop the table at a 3-0 record, the only other team with three wins is UC Irvine, whom UCSB will be facing at home next week. Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State find themselves at the middle of the table, both with only two wins. An important week for the Gauchos in terms of conference standing and opponent difficulty, snagging two road wins would mean the world for UCSB’s competitive campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is set to travel and face Cal State Fullerton this Thursday, Jan. 24, at 7 p.m., then Long Beach State this Saturday, Jan. 26, also at 7 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-85800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ucsb-set-to-travel-south-for-big-west-doubleheader/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-85800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ucsb-set-to-travel-south-for-big-west-doubleheader/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ucsb-set-to-travel-south-for-big-west-doubleheader/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ucsb-set-to-travel-south-for-big-west-doubleheader/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ucsb-set-to-travel-south-for-big-west-doubleheader/","id":1080,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1079,1078,1077],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
