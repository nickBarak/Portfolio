Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>This past Saturday, the Blue-Green rivalry between the No. 18 UCSB men’s soccer team and No. 22 Cal Poly delivered an absolute classic in front of nearly 15,000 fans in attendance and thousands more viewers on Fox Sports Prime Ticket. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, a 2-0 first half lead was not enough to avenge a 3-2 loss to the Mustangs seven days prior, as the road side was able to find an equalizer with just four seconds left in regulation to send the game to an eventual 2-2 tie.</p>\n<p>Despite the result, UCSB still remains in first place in the Big West North at 10-5-2 overall and 5-2-1 in conference. Cal Poly continues to linger just a point out of first with a record of 9-3-4 overall, 4-1-3 Big West.</p>\n<p>“We were four seconds from winning the game, so obviously, it’s a disappointed locker room,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We played a good first half, we got the two goals, I thought our defense was the best they’ve been all year. The frustration is that when you do a lot of the right things, hopefully the guys are rewarded at the end of the day.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The 14,919 members in the audience now take over last year’s Blue-Green game for the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history. Since 1980, 13 of the 19 largest crowds have been UCSB-Cal Poly matchups, with the largest ever (15,896) being when UCSB hosted UCLA back in 2010.</p>\n<p>The final seconds of regulation seemed to move in slow motion as the Gaucho faithful waited patiently for the clock to reach zero. With time running out, Cal Poly’s senior defender Kip Colvey sent in a cross towards the far post where senior forward Matt Lagrassa, who had been winning headers all night, rose above a UCSB defender to place a shot on goal, forcing freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg to make a remarkable one-handed save.</p>\n<p>“I could tell [Lagrassa] was going to head it to the far side. The ground is a little sloppy on that side of the field so I lost my footing a little bit but I was fortunate to get a hand out,” the younger Vom Steeg said. “To be honest I thought I should’ve done a little better with it, but with plays like that it happens pretty quickly, and when you have the ball bouncing around the six-yard box, you usually get punished.”</p>\n<p>The ball eventually fell to freshman forward Jared Pressley right inside the six-yard box, who scored a goal that will be remembered for years to come into the open net. It was just the second goal of his career.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZK2nP8X_W6o?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>“We’ve made this repeated mistake when balls get played into the box where we get stuck watching while the attacking player just keeps going forward,” Vom Steeg said. “That back post head ball is probably where [sophomore forward Kevin Feucht] would’ve been. It’s unfortunate because it takes away from a really good effort all night.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos dominated the game from the outset, looking comfortable playing in the spotlight of a much-hyped, televised game between two teams widely accepted to have the greatest rivalry in college soccer. It took little more than 10 minutes for them to open the scoring, as freshman forward Geoffrey Acheampong pounced on a loose ball in the attacking third to set up for the cross.</p>\n<p>After not scoring in seven consecutive games, sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani was found making a near post run to tap it in with his favored left foot, giving UCSB the early advantage.</p>\n<p>With fatigue and injuries forcing Vom Steeg to utilize his bench early and often, he was rewarded in the 43<sup>rd</sup> minute when freshman forward Cody Gibson played it in from the right wing to find a sky-high Nick DePuy. The junior forward outjumped his defender, placing a perfect header towards the far post and past Cal Poly senior goalkeeper Wade Hamilton to give UCSB a huge 2-0 advantage heading into halftime.</p>\n<p>“Physically, they could just not stay with [our forwards]. That’s where the gameplan was,” Vom Steeg said. “I asked Ahinga to start making his near post run, he hasn’t made it in the last five games. He made the run, and we got two good services.”</p>\n<p>The goal was DePuy’s Big West-leading 13<sup>th</sup> of the season.</p>\n<p>Things changed in the second half with the Gauchos facing the dilemma of sitting back or going for a third goal to put the game away. With Cal Poly sending men forward for the remainder of the game, UCSB eventually got punished on the break.</p>\n<p>In the 73<sup>rd</sup> minute, junior defender Jack O’Connor was all by himself down the left side, sending in a cross towards an unmarked Chase Minter in the box. The senior forward/midfielder put away a solid strike, giving him his fifth goal of the year and cutting the deficit in half.</p>\n<p>“We all know that Minter is a very good player. We all know that we need to not get beat out wide,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve spent the last two weeks working on finding men in the box, and if you’re going to leave anyone open, don’t leave their best player, that’s a pretty simple rule. We didn’t find him and it was a good finish.”</p>\n<p>From there, two overtime periods yielded few chances before a final corner kick by Acheampong hit the post as time expired. The result was the second consecutive 2-2 tie between the two teams at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“A lot of positive things that our team did tonight. Again, I feel bad for the players to be not going home tonight having won the game,” Vom Steeg said. “We are in first place and that is a top-20 RPI team, so we didn’t do anything bad tonight, but that’s going in my fourth column of games that we left out there this season. Hopefully we’ll learn and be here in a playoff situation saying we figured out with ten seconds left how to clear a ball.”</p>\n<p>It’s never fun to dwell on what-if scenarios, but had the Gauchos not lost Feucht, their best holding midfielder, to a suspension on yellow card accumulation, they may have been able to hold on in a game like this. In the German’s place, senior right back Duncan Backus, who Vom Steeg named the man of the match, stepped in to do a phenomenal job in an unfamiliar center defensive midfielder role.</p>\n<p>“I’m just happy that the coaches put the trust in me to play a position,” Backus said. “The main thing was just defend, work hard, connect my passes and get the ball to the dangerous guys that can go do damage. I just made sure that we aren’t missing Kevin too much.”</p>\n<p>If these two teams play each other again in the Big West Tournament, we can expect an even crazier atmosphere than the ones we’ve witnessed in the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>Next up for the Gauchos is a rematch against Sacramento St. on Wednesday at home.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/classic-blue-green-rivalry-game-ends-in-2-2-tie/","id":1486,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1485,1484,1483],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson","biography":"Not available","articles":[121,137,246,247,249,250,342,355,358,359,360,377,378,380,384,386,390,394,397,399,400,404,405,413,415,417,418,421,428,432,435,436,438,443,445,459,460,462,463,464,466,469,475,477,480,482,483,486,495,497,498,499,500,501,505,545,599,843,967,968,971,982,984,985,986,987,988,989,990,991,992,993,994,995,1016,1017,1019,1020,1021,1023,1024,1025,1107,1147,1173,1198,1400,1462,1463,1464,1469,1470,1471,1472,1474,1476,1477,1478,1481,1482,1483,1485,1486,1487,1495,1498,1501,1502,1504,1507,1508,1509,1510,1511,1514,1516,1517,1519,1521,1523,1525,1533,1534,1535,1536,1537,1538,1543,1544,1545,1546,1547,1548,1551,1552,1553,1556,1557,1559,1985,1994,1999,2028,2033,2039,2066,3210,3219,3230,3241,3258,3285,3289,3291,3295,5051,5065,5067,5078,5083,5084,5086,5087,5090,5091,5092,5093,5094,5095,5096,5099,5100,5243,5262,5276,5277,5278,5279,5280,5281,5282,5283,5284,5285,5286,5288,5293,5305,5306,5308,5309,5312,5313],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Preparing For Competitive Finish to the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer9-26ChristinaDeMarzo7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WomensSoccer9-26ChristinaDeMarzo7-web.jpg?resize=397%2C600&ssl=1","description":"With just four conference matches left on the season, the UCSB women's soccer team prepares for the final stretch of its season before the start of the Big West Tournament on Nov. 5th.

The Gauchos start a tough road ahead as all four teams are in contention for a playoff spot including 3-2 UC Riverside and 2-2 UC Irvine. This is familiar news for Stumpf, though.</p>\n<p>“Every year heading into the last weekend of the season, six or seven teams of the nine teams total still have a mathematical chance at the tournament,” said Stumpf. “[Because of this], every game is critical. If you have one game a year against somebody and you’re better than them you need to get the result.”</p>\n<p>UC Riverside heads into its Friday night match ranking in the top four in goals with 23. Much of the Highlanders’ scoring can be accredited to redshirt junior midfielder Blanco Barrio. The San Bernardino native scored both goals in the Highlander’s 2-1 road victory on Friday against then No. 1 Long Beach State. The 49ers had been undefeated until their loss last weekend.</p>\n<p>Barrio’s performance was acknowledged on Monday as she earned herself the Big West Player of the Week award. Barrio now leads the team in scoring with 16 points off five goals and six assists, good for fifth place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The junior midfielder will not be suiting up for the Highlanders after being issued two late yellow cards in their 1-0 loss to Fullerton on Sunday.</p>\n<p>For UC Irvine, look for sophomore forward Kiana Palacios and sophomore midfielder Alex Karlowitsch to be the primary weapons on offense. The two sophomores lead the team in scoring with two goals apiece and a combination of 12 points. Palacios finished with a team-high five shots and one go-ahead goal on Sunday, leading to a 2-0 victory over Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Containing Palacios and Karlowitsch in the open field will be a big focus for the Gauchos and junior defender Sydney Fuertes. Fuertes played a central role in Santa Barbara’s two wins over Cal Poly and Davis. The junior from San Clemente earned the Big West Defensive Player of the Week award after her contributions on the defensive line.</p>\n<p>UCSB will honor its seniors prior to Friday night’s match with UC Riverside. Kickoff will take place at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium. The Gauchos will welcome UCI on Sunday at 1 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

soccer team in 2015. With just four games remaining in the regular season, the Gauchos play UC Davis today and No. 20 Cal Poly on Saturday, leading both teams by just a point for first place in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>Two straight losses on the road has set Santa Barbara back to a record of 9-5-1 overall and 4-2 in the conference. Meanwhile, Davis enters today’s game at Harder Stadium at 7-6-2 overall, 3-1-2 Big West.</p>\n<p>“Our season does in effect come down to this week,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Last week is done, but we can’t forget why we lost both games. I’m excited that our guys are going to show up tomorrow and play really hard against a team that’s been playing really well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After starting conference play a perfect 4-0, the Gauchos crashed back down to Earth with a rough 5-2 loss at Sacramento St. last Wednesday. Playing at rival Cal Poly just three days later, UCSB was unable to hold on late, falling 3-2 in double overtime.</p>\n<p>“The Big West conference is not kind. You have to play well in every game,” Vom Steeg said. ”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, they will get a shot to play both teams again, this time on their home field. UCSB has once again had its fair share of success playing under the lights of Harder Stadium, owning a 5-1 mark at home this season.</p>\n<p>Getting back on the winning track may just have to do with the play of junior forward Nick DePuy. With seven game-winners this year, DePuy has more than any player in the nation. His 12 scores overall is tied for second.</p>\n<p>The 6-4 Irvine native had scored in five consecutive games prior to last week’s two-game road trip, and it seems to be no coincidence that when his streak ended, so did his team’s. In games where DePuy has scored over the last two seasons, UCSB has gone an undefeated 15-0-3.</p>\n<p>Giving support on the Gauchos’ offensive front is a wide combination of attacking options that includes three dangerous lefties.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Ahinga Selemani ranks second in the Big West in shots with 43, behind only DePuy. The pressure he has applied to back lines this year tells much more than his three goal, two assist stat line will.</p>\n<p>A leading candidate for Big West Freshman of the Year in Geoffrey Acheampong has been the Gauchos’ best creator all season. To go along with his three goals, the forward’s seven assists ranks first in the conference and seventh in the nation. He has recorded a point in eight of UCSB’s last ten games, accumulating a record of 7-2-1 when he has scored or assisted this season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ last two outings also saw the return of junior left back Ismaila Jome from an ankle sprain that kept him out for nearly eight full games. Proving that he’s back and ready to make an impact heading into the postseason, Jome put away a goal in each of last week’s losses – his first two scores of the season.</p>\n<p>With most of the starting lineup ready to go at this point, the pressure falls on UCSB’s defense to get the job done as it tries to secure a No. 1 seed. The Gauchos have conceded 11 goals in their six conference games this season, just one less than last-ranked Sac St. and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“To be 14, 15 games into the season and dominating games, but then giving up excellent scoring opportunities, it’s a recipe for disaster,” Vom Steeg said. “The way we’re going to bounce back is with a renewed commitment to defending. Not just our defenders, but some of our forwards coming down. We need to go back from giving up eight goals last week to giving up none, or one.”</p>\n<p>For the Aggies, defense has not been as much of an issue, giving up just six through six Big West games. They own the conference’s longest active unbeaten streak at four games, all of which went into overtime.</p>\n<p>Senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg has scored seven goals this season to lead the offense, tied for second in the conference. More recently, redshirt freshman defender Roy Boateng has given solid production, recording a brace in a 3-2 win over Cal Poly last Wednesday and picking up the assist on Davis’s lone goal against Sac St. on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s focus tonight will be solely on getting a win, but win or lose, that focus will quickly shift to Saturday’s game with Cal Poly. The Mustangs are also in action tonight, playing Sac St. at home as they look to surpass both UCSB and Davis in the standings.</p>\n<p>“Every year it comes down to something like this,” Vom Steeg said. “When you’re the team that gets the bullseye like we do, we have to rise to that challenge every time we play. The players know what’s at stake and I believe they are committed to give us the effort that we need.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos and Aggies are set for kickoff tonight at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65639\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65639\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-21/defining-week-for-no-19-ucsb-begins-tonight-against-uc-davis/","id":1483,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1482,1481,1480],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 19 UCSB Downs UC Davis in First of Crucial Three-Game Homestand","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-v-UC-Irvine-Big-West-Semis-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7097.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Soccer-v-UC-Irvine-Big-West-Semis-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7097.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"One down, three to go before the conclusion of the 2015 regular season.

Sophomore midfielder Kevin Feucht scored twice from the penalty spot, giving him four goals in the last four games, as he led his team to a crucial 2-1 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“Really the story of tonight is we did enough to win and that’s all there really is to say about it,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said after the game.</p>\n<p>The win ends a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos, keeping them just one point in front of No. 20 Cal Poly for first place in the Big West North Division. UCSB is now 10-5-1 overall and 5-2 in conference, while the Aggies, who had gone undefeated in four straight, fall four points out of first at 7-7-2 overall, 3-2-2 Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Playing without junior midfielder Josue Espana, who was suspended after picking up two yellow cards in UCSB’s game last Saturday at Cal Poly, the Gauchos struggled to find a flow on their offensive half.</p>\n<p>“Josue has started and played basically every minute for us and he controls the middle of our field. That made a huge difference,” Vom Steeg said. “Without him in the game, we were lost.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the Gauchos, a pair of crucial mistakes by Davis defenders cost them the game.</p>\n<p>After controlling the game through the first 15 minutes, midfielder Seo-In Kim brought the ball down the right flank before sophomore defender Greg Salazar’s attempted clearance came right back down off Kim’s arm. The junior transfer from Duke quickly recovered the ball before sending in a cross, ironically coming off of Salazar’s arm this time and resulting in a UCSB penalty.</p>\n<p>“There are referees where literally no matter what happens on the field, they’re not going to call it,” Vom Steeg said. “The referee tonight will call PKs. Definitely the arm was stretched, so I thought that first one was a good PK call.”</p>\n<p>It was Feucht who stepped up to take the penalty for the Gauchos, as he did against Cal State Fullerton in UCSB’s last home outing 11 days prior. The German showed great composure from the spot, seeming to hesitate at the last moment before taking the shot. After seeing Davis redshirt junior goalkeeper Armando Quezada go left, Feucht calmly slotted the ball into the right corner, giving the Gauchos an early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>“The first half we were moving so well. It was just a matter of time,” Kim said. “Fortunately, we got a cross and [Salazar] handballed it, and Kevin of course is going to tuck it away.”</p>\n<p>Following a solid first 20 minutes of play, UCSB was unable to establish any kind of offensive flow for the rest of the first half. As the second half kicked off, momentum quickly turned the Aggies’ way, as they forced turnovers in the Gauchos’ defensive third and came close to scoring on a number of occasions.</p>\n<p>Davis finally found an equalizer in the 74<sup>th</sup> minute off a long throw into the box. A scramble for the ball resulted in a poor defensive clearance from just in front of goal and junior defender Steven Guzman capitalized, lobbing a header over freshman goalkeeper Justin Vom Steeg from about eight yards out to tie the game at 1-1.</p>\n<p>“In general, I thought we did decent [defending] the throw in,” Vom Steeg said. “But you put enough bodies inside the six yard box and bounce it around and do it 15 times… I hope everybody knows it’s not really soccer.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ unorthodox attacking methods brought them level with UCSB, but not for long. Just 70 seconds after the equalizer, junior forward Nick DePuy beat his defender in the box before being dragged down by a reckless tackle from senior defender/midfielder Lucas Mohageg, awarding UCSB its second penalty of the night.</p>\n<p>“Nick did a good job of dropping his shoulder and getting in front of [Mohageg],” Vom Steeg said. “As a defender at that point, I’d let him go a little bit, but the minute Nick got in front and the defender now is trying to save the day with a tackle, I would say around the world that one gets called.”</p>\n<p>Once again, it was Feucht stepping up to put the Gauchos up by one, this time firing it into the left corner with no hesitation while Quezada dove to the right post. That would be the high moment of the game for Feucht, who celebrated with a spectacular flip after notching his fourth goal for UCSB in as many games.</p>\n<p>From there, the Gauchos were able to hold on for the 2-1 victory, but they suffered another huge loss before the game was over. With just 4:33 remaining, a free kick that was awarded to Davis was delayed when Feucht kicked the ball away, resulting in his fifth yellow card of the season.</p>\n<p>This means that UCSB will be without its best holding midfielder for an even more crucial matchup with second place Cal Poly this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it feels like a loss is because we did lose [Feucht] tonight on a fifth yellow,” Vom Steeg said. “We seem to make mistakes that really hurt us, and that’s obviously a mistake because there was no point. Now you’ve got two days to redo all your set pieces and your defensive marking because you’ve got to drop a new player in.”</p>\n<p>Already facing the challenges of fatigue, injuries, and a top-20 ranked Cal Poly team that just beat UCSB 3-2 in double overtime last Saturday, Feucht’s suspension could not have come at a worse time.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard for me to walk in and scream, yell and get animated when the reality is the guys are giving you everything they have. At some point you just get tired,” Vom Steeg said. “You’re now deep into the bench. It’s why we carry 28 players and you’ll have to see a bunch of them Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Despite his frustrations after a grueling contest, Vom Steeg was still able to find one silver lining.</p>\n<p>“At least, good news, Josue will be fresh,” he said with a smile.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry game will be played for the second time in seven days this Saturday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>The Aggies will get their shot at revenge against the Gauchos in both team’s regular season finale at Davis on Halloween.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/no-20-ucsb-downs-uc-davis-in-first-of-crucial-three-game-homestand/","id":1485,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1484,1483,1482],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
