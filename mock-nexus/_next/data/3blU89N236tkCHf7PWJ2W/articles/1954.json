Beyond providing security, portable toilets and parking, the university has no role in putting together the event; instead, members of the Associated Students Program Board (ASPB) spend months gathering booking data about artists, reaching out to their agents and narrowing down the list of potential performers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathaly Pacheco, special events coordinator for ASPB, fields requests from students and other board members about the genres of music or artists they want to see perform at the annual event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure we cater to what you guys want,” Pacheco said, emphasizing that events are funded by student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With board as a whole, no matter what we do, we have to think students are our number one priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past week, Pacheco and the rest of the ASPB staff have been working to ensure the show runs smoothly. On Saturday, Pacheco and the production coordinator will be starting their day at 7 a.m. to oversee the set up of all the production equipment, like the audio, lighting and any special equipment Program Board ordered at the artist’s request. They won’t go home until 2 a.m., when they wrap up clean-up for the show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco, who is going into her third year on Program Board, said her experience on the board in previous years has helped her work with other members more cohesively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I truly feel like you can’t be a good leader unless you know what the other people that are working for you are doing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this year’s show, and her time on Program Board as a whole, Pacheco said it was important to her to bring a diverse lineup to campus; she pointed out that UCSB has never had a female headliner perform at any of their shows. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a big problem, even within the industry; it’s like such an issue of seeing powerful women or seeing women being represented in this specific industry,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said Program Board was actually in touch with Megan Thee Stallion to bring her for Delirium but said the timing didn’t work out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Leikeli47, one of the supporting acts at this year’s Delirium, Pacheco said the board tries its best to “bring and showcase diversity when it comes to the artists that we bring to the campus and stay on the wave of artists that we think are only going to keep growing and growing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really, really want to make sure that we do that this year,” she said. “I know that we have a really big Latinx community here at this school — it’s the second biggest demographic — but we don’t cater to Spanish music or other different genres of music.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, program board commissioner, emphasized Pacheco’s sentiments about wanting to invite more student input to Program Board’s internal processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’d like [students] to meet the Program Board people, and then also make our office hours available so they can come in at any time, talk to anyone, not only for talking about the programs that we do, but if they need help doing events or if they are interested in working or volunteering with us,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Morrison pointed to the Associated Students’ Finance and Business Committee’s public posts last year that documented where student fees were going and said that was something she was interested in implementing, particularly because Program Board has a high lock-in fee, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Program Board is working with a budget of $1,110,106.25 for the 2019-2020 academic year, according to a budget presented by last year’s commissioner, Ryanne Ross, at the end of last year. While a lot of the budget goes toward the larger special events, Program Board also puts on regular Free Tuesday Films, Storke Tower shows, shows in the Hub, lectures and other events throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the money that Program Board makes from charging for smaller events goes toward subsidizing costs for larger events, Morrison added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to events like Delirium, Morrison and Pacheco said the safety of students is of the utmost priority to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We throw a lot of big festivals where a lot of people are drunk and that kind of stuff, and also, police are required to be there,” Morrison said. “We’re on the student side … we are here for you guys and we want to make sure you are safe, first and foremost.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacheco said police presence at this year’s show is expected to be the same as previous years, and that students can expect metal detectors and pat-downs outside of the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that Halloween here is pretty dead, and it’s just like, people go home, people decide to go to other places,” Pacheco said. “This is one of the things that people can do in a fun and safe way.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The new $10,000 amount is meant to reflect the average cost of in-state tuition at public, four-year institutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t wait any longer to act on student debt, and the Degrees Not Debt Act is a solid way to make financial aid and college more accessible to more people. The cost to attend UCSB as an in-state student is more than $12,000, but the Pell Grant currently caps off at $6,195,” Carbajal wrote in a statement to the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to do more for our students, and I’m glad to have worked with student advocates across the state over the past year to make this idea a reality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The re-introduction of a bill to increase the maximum amount of the Federal Pell Grant award comes during a time when conversations about both tuition and student debt are subjects of heavy debate on the national stage. This past summer, Democratic presidential candidates </span><a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/debt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elizabeth Warren</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bernie Sanders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> both introduced plans to cancel student debt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 72% of UCSB students received some form of financial aid through the university during the 2018-19 school year, according to UCSB’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2018.19.pdf\">campus profile.</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a really big increase,” External Vice President for Statewide Affairs Daevionne Beasley said. “That is a lot of money, especially to a low-income student, these thousands of dollars matter.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The aid is only a bandaid to the larger institutional problem of charging people astronomical amounts of money for a good education,” he added. “I will always be an advocate for free college and free tuition… but until we can get to that point, the more financial aid, the better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the EVPSA office’s legislative agenda has not been finalized yet, Beasley said that the EVPSA office will be advocating for the Degrees Not Debt Act on future lobbying trips. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [Oct. 19, 2:16 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-90612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The exhibit uses photographs, articles and other items from the university archives. <em>Katherine Swartz/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Located on the third floor of the Davidson Library, the exhibit uses photographs, articles and other items from the university archives to show the changes in UCSB’s academic reputation in the 75 years since UCSB joined the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Stahl, who became the first dedicated university archivist of UCSB in 2017, was in charge of designing and curating the exhibit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to pay homage to some of the institutions before, but there have been a lot of exhibits already in the library about the Anna Blake school and other preceding institutions. So we didn’t want to get bogged down in the pre-history of the institution,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhibit is sorted by decade from the 1940s onwards. Some of the earlier decades include digitized copies of old photographs and poster copies of the El Gaucho student newspaper, which was an early iteration of what is now known as the Daily Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the other exhibits that we’ve done, they draw from … maybe one or two collections. For this one, I mean we have 130 different collections from just the university archives … Some of them are huge, some of them are just like one or two boxes, but I mean there was a lot more material to sift through,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had to make sure that it stuck with the story of the exhibit. And the story of the exhibit is how did this little sleepy beachside college grow from being a small liberal arts college to a world-class research leader. So we had to make sure that all the things we wanted to put in the exhibit related to that transition.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key element to UCSB’s transformation was the dissolution of the home economics department and the creation of the Black studies, Chicana and Chicano studies and environmental studies departments in the late 1960s. The shift in curriculum during the period was the academic response to the broader cultural change in UCSB’s student body during the time period, according to Stahl.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl notes through the exhibit a “crisis” of declining enrollment throughout the 1970s following the Bank of America burning and Isla Vista riots of 1970. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if our reputation [was] suffering, I think you can look at it best as growing pains, that the university was really trying to find its new identity and struggle with what kind of institution it’s supposed to be,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the first half of the exhibit — up to the 1970s — uses photographs and documents from that time, Stahl found there were less archival documents from the 1980s to now. Because there was no university archivist until Stahl was hired in 2017, departments and organizations were responsible for archiving their own work — which often was not properly preserved, if archived at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t have enough material necessarily to have a case for each decade,” Stahl said. “So we from this point changed it to research focus, like what have we done well in the field of research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three displays for the 1980s to the present include a dedication to achievements in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering and mathematics (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S.T.E.M.), one for research in the social sciences and humanities and a third displaying photos of UCSB’s six Nobel Laureates, along with a bronze duplicate Nobel Prize provided by former physics professor Walter Kohn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the modern exhibit section focuses on research, Stahl hopes that the exhibit will help UCSB student and faculty leaders understand the importance of archiving their work for future years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I would have liked to have more of, for example, would be student organization materials in the exhibit. But we don’t have a lot of materials from [Associated Students] clubs and so basically student organizations don’t always know the best way to preserve their materials,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully this will kind of generate awareness there that if you’re a student organization on campus and you have historical records, we are willing and able to preserve them for you here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl and his team of curators — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Collections Librarians David Gartrell and Yolanda Blue and Processing Archivist Leland Riddlesperger </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> strived through Campus by the Sea to not only focus on UCSB’s previous evolution into a research institution but also what lies ahead in the university’s future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curators incorporated this element through photographs of current students on a wall in the exhibit. Students answered questions about how their university experience has shaped them and their hopes for the future of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yolanda Blue noticed that as UCSB’s population continued to grow since it first became a UC, so has its reputation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus started as a small liberal arts campus, very small in concept and focus. And now, 75 years later, we’re known worldwide as a world-class research university. The growth – how the campus has transitioned over the years in spite of all the different events that have taken place,” Blue said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve acquired so many different departments and Nobel Prize winners … it’s inspirational, as you can tell from the comments made by the students that we interviewed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening reception for Campus by the Sea will be held on Thursday from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Special Research Collections area of the library on the third floor mountain side. An open house will also be held on Nov. 1 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhibit will be open on the third floor in the Special Research Collections until July and can also be viewed digitally through the Campus by the Sea website.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Levine, claims that the officers, due to the accusations of “misconduct, dishonesty, and improper investigative techniques,” “intentionally violated” Galoustian’s right to due process and a fair trial, according to a motion filed with the court on Oct. 3. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levine attached copies of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by former UCPD Officer Ryan Smith, referred to as John Doe in court documents, as well as articles by the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/05/09/whistleblower-lawsuits-blow-lid-off-ucsb-police/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the Daily Nexus describing the lawsuit, as supporting documents for the motion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion names Officers Ryan Hashimoto, Michael Little and Tiffany Little as well as Lieutenant Mark Signa and argues that “the defense needs the requested information to properly prepare for trial on this matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, the defense argues that because Hashimoto allegedly circulated a video “of an alleged sexual assault that was evidence in [Galoustian’s] case,” the video tapes have been “tampered with and no longer reflect the original content.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the motion, Levine also referenced an allegation in the UCPD lawsuits that said “many reports were being taken by UCSBPD officers, sanctioned by Signa, where males were being listed as rape and sexual assault suspects, despite no evidence of a crime occurring.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Traits of dishonesty, misconduct, false sexual assault reports, and improper investigative techniques are very relevant issues in this matter, as is whether or not Hashimoto and the other officers and employees of UCSBPD tampered with video or audio evidence in this and in other cases,” Levine wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion requests: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The name, address and telephone number of all persons who accuses any above-named officer of acts constituting misconduct.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name, address and telephone number of all persons who were interviewed as potential witnesses to any of the aforementioned accusations of misconduct.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name, address and telephone number of all persons who accuses any above named officer of making false, misleading or inaccurate statements (or committing any other misconduct, such as threatening or coercing or interfering with witnesses), orally, in writing or in any other form, during an official, internal affairs or any other investigation conducted by the Investigating Department or any other agency.
