Hell, Phil Jackson once said Dennis Rodman was the most athletic player he’s ever coached. Not MJ.</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Statistically, Kobe and LeBron have each averaged over 30 a game more than once in their careers. Both have similar numbers in their primes (LeBron likely hasn’t reached his yet, Kobe’s over the hump), multiple All-Defensive First Team awards, MVP awards and so on. Kobe will never reach LeBron’s career 27.1 ppg average. LeBron may never replicate Kobe’s 81-point game. Still, they’ve both shown they can do whatever they want to on the court.</p>\n<p>But so has Dirk Nowitzki this season. So have Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony. With so many players (eight this season) capable of putting up 25-plus points per game over a season, how should we measure greatness?</p>\n<p>Greatness should be measured by the number of rings a player earns on teams that he undisputedly leads. The “undisputed leader” distinction disqualifies role players on great teams from the list of the greatest.</p>\n<p>Kobe has five rings. Two of those rings were on teams where he was the undisputed star, but it can be argued that he rode shotgun with Shaquille O’Neal for the other three.</p>\n<p>LeBron has none. The Heat may win this season, but the league and media consensus is that the team belongs to Dwayne Wade or the trio of Wade, James and Chris Bosh. Not LeBron James alone.</p>\n<p>When discussing two players with the potential to go down in history in the top 20 players of all time, symbolism, peer perception and legacy are more important factors than statistics. This is why players believe some championships are better than others. This is why a January poll suggesting that 79 percent of general managers would choose Kobe over any other player to take the last shot — in spite of Kobe’s 25-percent rate in clutch situations — is so significant.</p>\n<p>Michael sweeping the Detroit Bad Boys on the way to his first championship: symbolically one of the most important moments of his career. Kobe winning his first without Shaq — symbolically his most important.</p>\n<p>James leaving his hometown team for greener pastures and the potential for a ring: symbolically the most detrimental action of his career thus far. Both MJ and Magic Johnson spoke out against LeBron’s move south, because both understood the importance of leadership to a legacy.</p>\n<p>LeBron was almost there in Cleveland, but he didn’t finish what he started and now we’ll never know how great of a leader he could have been.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, the Mavs’ sweep of the Lakers could mark the end of Kobe’s reign over the NBA or the beginning of a new Laker dynasty with fresh blood surrounding Kobe. I wouldn’t be surprised either way. But any player that comes to L.A. knows he’s giving up a chance at forging his own legacy in exchange for contributing to Kobe’s.</p>\n<p>For now, LeBron must settle for being the most athletic, most entertaining player in the NBA. He has a way to go.</p>\n<p>At least he’s still in the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>NBA columnist Ravi Bhatia does far more things than just this column “Black Mamba style.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-38305\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-38305\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-10/hoop-dreams-ravis-response-black-mamba-style/","id":2133,"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia"},"related":[2132,2131,2130],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":90,"name":"Ravi Bhatia","biography":"Not available","articles":[114,207,291,610,826,827,829,830,831,832,835,850,859,860,864,866,872,873,875,876,878,888,893,897,903,906,909,910,911,912,916,918,923,1711,1718,1721,1734,1735,1737,1738,1754,2037,2133,2156,2300,2889,2891,3141,3170,4553,4555,4556,5531,5549],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Begin Final Four Competition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After an incredible undefeated season, the Gauchos (10-0) will face Bowling Green University (9-0) in the Final Four this afternoon at Steuber Rugby Stadium at Stanford University to fight for the tit...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After an incredible undefeated season, the Gauchos (10-0) will face Bowling Green University (9-0) in the Final Four this afternoon at Steuber Rugby Stadium at Stanford University to fight for the title.</p>\n<p>This is the first time in Gaucho history that the men’s rugby team has progressed this far in the U.S.A.

My new strategy is to stock up on pitching, but to take hitters if I think a run is starting.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I was right that my pitching was going to be awesome. Josh Johnson, Jon Lester and Roy Halladay have been knocking down fools like bowling pins all season. And since my hitters can’t find their swings, they are the reason my fantasy team is still doing well.</p>\n<p>I was right about a few lesser-known players. Kyle McClellan, though he has started to come back down to earth, is still 5-1 with a 3.62 ERA, making him a great option. Josh Tomlin is also 5-1. He won’t strike out many, but he has yet to let off more than three runs in a start and has given up that many in just two of his eight starts so far.</p>\n<p>I was right about the Red Sox being able to recover from their awful start. Jon Lester and Josh Beckett held that team together through the force of their combined will until the hitting came around. Now that it has, I can confidently return to my Red Sox division title prediction.</p>\n<p>I was right about the San Francisco Giants. To my friends who are Giants fans: try not to get mad, but the Giants suck. Last season’s World Series win was a fluke. True, the Giants are in first place, but seriously, the NL West is a joke.</p>\n<p>I was wrong that drafting fast was the best strategy in fantasy drafts. Yes, it cuts down on draft time and therefore increases the chance that you’ll leave with your sanity intact, but it also increases the chances that you’ll miss out on that one player that could catapult you to the top of your league. If you’re going to take the time to sit through a draft, you might as well do a thorough job of drafting.</p>\n<p>I was wrong about Justin Bieber. I used to think that he was the worst thing to happen to music, but Rebecca Black has proved me wrong. She has convinced me that music is officially dead, and every time I hear her song, which I refuse to mention by name, I die a little bit on the inside.</p>\n<p>I was, unfortunately, right about the NFL labor situation. The lockout is still in effect and there are no signs that it is going to lift anytime soon. I would not be at all surprised if there was no football next season and honestly, that might be good for the NFL. Those rich bastards will learn that their fans aren’t so loyal that they will put up with this nonsense and maybe, just maybe, football will once again become about the fans instead of the money. But probably not.</p>\n<p>Finally, I was wrong that I wouldn’t resort to shameless self-promotion. If you check out my twitter (@jgreenbergnexus) you’ll get a preview of what I’m going to talk about in my column each week, as well as a number of other things you definitely need to know.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We still aren’t convinced Daily Nexus columnist Joshua Greenberg thinks about anything other than fantasy baseball.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/","id":2130,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2129,2128,2127],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Resolution Keeps Former A.S.

On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon and College of Letters &amp; Science Senator Xochitl Briseno proposed a resolution at the Jan. 23 Senate meeting which reflects on King’s impact during his time at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The resolution, officially known as “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” will award five student leaders who each exhibit “outstanding contributions to A.S or the student body as well as academic excellence.” Each award includes a $500 grant funded by A.S., according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Senate voted unanimously in favor of the resolution.</p>\n<p>“He was always going out of his way to support students academically and emotionally,” Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major, said. “That’s why I created the award, because it is specifically for students who go above and beyond who aren’t necessarily compensated for that.”</p>\n<p>Solomon, who first met King through a Guiding Underrepresented Individuals in Developing Educational Success (G.U.I.D.E.S.) Summer Orientation, remembered that he took the time to share academic tips to first-generation college students who were concerned about how to succeed in school.</p>\n<p>As an advisor, King, a former black studies major at UCSB, emphasized to his students the importance of grades and time management. King strived to ensure students had the time they needed to excel in school while fulfilling their roles in A.S. and extracurriculars, according to Solomon.</p>\n<p>“[King] would always walk into a room and be like, ‘How are we doing on grades? Thumbs up or thumbs down?’ or ‘Are we shooting for a 4.0?’” Solomon said. “Just reminding people that we’re students first and leaders second and he displays that as well.”</p>\n<p>Alexandra Gessesse, a third-year history of public policy major, former A.S. senator and student sponsor of the resolution, remembers first meeting King through the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E) in her first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The first thing he asked me was ‘What do you want to do with your time here at UCSB?’” Gessesse said. “It hit me that someone sees me as more than my purpose of running with a party or running in A.S. or being a 4.0 student.”</p>\n<p>King often went above and beyond to make sure that the students he worked with received the attention they needed to succeed, she said.</p>\n<p>“There would be days, like even if he’s busy in a meeting, his doors’ window blinds are never closed – they’re open – so you can see in and he can wave at you, so he can acknowledge you,” said Gessesse.</p>\n<p>However, academics weren’t always on King’s radar.</p>\n<p>After being accepted into UCSB when he applied in high school, the university rescinded King’s acceptance after he received multiple failing grades during his senior year of high school.</p>\n<p>Instead of attending UCSB out of high school, King attended a community college for a semester in order to regain his acceptance from UCSB.</p>\n<p>Like many of the students he worked with, King had commitments outside of academics during college. He was a member of the UCSB men’s basketball team, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, Incorporated, a transfer advisor, a member of 100 Black College Men and worked in the Educational Opportunity Program as well as the Early Academic Outreach Program.</p>\n<p>After graduating in 2001, King returned to the university to work as an assistant Judicial Affairs coordinator where he helped the run the judicial process for all university housing facilities on campus.</p>\n<p>King then left in 2008 to work as the assistant dean of students at the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>According to King, during his time at the Claremont University Consortium, he created a program called “A Plus,” where he helped give students academic advising.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“There would be days, like even if he’s busy in a meeting, his doors’ window blinds are never closed – they’re open – so you can see in and he can wave at you, so he can acknowledge you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Pretty much the way that I built A Plus was ‘What did I need when I was coming from Compton and Carson to Santa Barbara?‘” King said. “So I created A Plus for me… for 16, 17 year-old LaDonte King.”</p>\n<p>In 2011, King departed from the Claremont University Consortium. Four years after that, King found himself, once again, working for his alma mater.</p>\n<p>In the time spent between working for the Claremont University Consortium and UCSB, King managed two academic advising services: A+ For Excellence and Graduating Champions. Both services were derived from the A Plus program he founded while working at the Claremont University Consortium.</p>\n<p>Until last December, King specifically spent his time at UCSB engaging with A.S. senators and executives to aid them in their academic success.</p>\n<p>“Especially with regards to politics with such division, the one thing that everyone has in common is school. We’re all here for the same reason. You all are in school. So that’s going to be my thing,” King said.</p>\n<p>Although his time at UCSB was greatly appreciated, King made the decision to leave the university to pursue his passion and once again manage his academic advising services.</p>\n<p>“I’m so excited about it, I get to focus solely on my passion to work my noble purpose … to be able to solely focus on academic success. It’s like a breath of fresh air because I love this work.”</p>\n<p>Presently, King is the CEO of A+ For Excellence and Graduating Champions. While both services offer academic advising, Graduating Champions is catered to student athletes, like King himself, so they can better manage their time between sports and school.</p>\n<p>Although King is now pursuing his passions elsewhere, students like Gessesse find themselves reminiscing about their time with him.</p>\n<p>“I can’t envision what [students] will experience without him here, because that’s how much of an impact that he had … He was like my muse, my Pandora’s box to understanding my time here at UCSB,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus <em>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
