As a Los Angeles Lakers diehard fan, I don’t remember a year where my enthusiasm for the impending NBA season was so low. Nevertheless, basketball is a sport I love and will always love, so I will watch, I will enjoy and I will feel some sense of satisfaction when my predictions for the 2013-2014 season come true.</p>\n<p><strong>LeBron James will win his fifth MVP award and the Miami Heat will repeat (again)</strong></p>\n<p>Told you these predictions wouldn’t be surprising. LeBron has firmly established his place as one of the greatest NBA players of all time, and he’s still in his prime at the age of 28. The only wings you could throw in the same sentence would be Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. And even that’s an unfair comparison to James since he plays all five positions as well as anyone in history, including Magic Johnson. Nothing short of a devastating injury or Kevin Durant scoring 50 points a game will knock the King off his throne.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>The Los Angeles Lakers will miss the playoffs for the third time since 1976</strong></p>\n<p>This pains me to write, but even the most loyal Lakers fans see the writing on the wall. Last season’s seventh place finish was a complete disaster, and the team has been blown up with no significant improvements in the offseason. Dwight Howard abandoned ship after failing to live up to the hype while recovering from surgery. Now the hopes of the Lakers rest in the hands of Canada’s founding father Steve Nash, a pair of seven-foot cavemen [age and facial hair considered] in Pau Gasol and Chris Kaman, and a trigger happy journeyman wing referred to as “Swaggy P.” Shooting guard Nick Young fills the void left by Kobe Bryant and figures to be the Lakers’ leading scorer as long as Kobe is rehabbing. Of course, Kobe is the toughest athlete in the nation and could surprise everyone with an early triumphant return, and Pau is aging gracefully as a still effective starter. But the stars are aligned for the team in red that plays at Staples Center this year.</p>\n<p><strong>The 76ers will “win” the “waste for Wiggins” race</strong></p>\n<p>With the balance of power in the NBA extremely top-heavy for the last decade, teams realize that being awful and throwing a season in the hopes of landing the top pick in the draft is more advisable than dwelling in mediocrity for years and years. Just ask the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors and Portland Trail Blazers, among others. The 76ers could be historically bad, with the Andrew Bynum experiment ending in failure and their best player Jrue Holiday being traded for a first round pick with a torn ACL. Nerlens Noel is out for the season, leaving Evan Turner as the only solid starter on the entire roster. Spencer Hawes has shown flashes of being a very productive player, but the team will still be awful even with those two playing their best basketball.</p>\n<p>We could see some great stories this season. The Cavaliers could return to contention, the Pacers will be better this year, and the return of Derrick Rose to the Bulls could give the Heat a run for their money. But at the top of the hierarchy, the song remains the same. Cheers to classic rock references.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 23, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52587\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52587\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-23/three-cant-miss-predictions-entering-the-nba-season/","id":2084,"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco"},"related":[2083,2082,2081],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":74,"name":"Josh Fiacco","biography":"Not available","articles":[597,2058,2084,2086,3196,3224,3228,3235,3239,3240,3242,3245,3250,3251,5105,5107,5108],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Second Instance of Anti-Semitism Reported Within the Same Week","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The statement expressed a need for change through a demand for “Nazi symbols” to be considered a terrorist act.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several sociology, political science, global studies and environmental studies graduate students at UC Santa Barbara released a statement on April 4 regarding an incident of anti-Semitism that took place two days prior, labeling the incident as a “terrorist act.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement alleges that on the morning of April 2, a man was seen walking “the hallways of the UCSB Sociology department wearing a ‘Waffen SS’ (Nazi death squad) t-shirt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement was contacted immediately after the individual was seen by a graduate student who reported the individual walking through the building, according to the statement. The statement also noted that department staff and campus security were made aware of the incident around the same time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man was not apprehended and disappeared before law enforcement arrived, according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement was signed by Marisa D.

Senate released a formal statement regarding the flyers, denouncing it as “extremely derogatory” and “obscenely misrepresentative of Jewish people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We call upon the UCSB student body to actively stand in solidarity with our Jewish community by spreading awareness and education about anti-Semitism, and to quickly report any concering behavior,” the A.S. statement read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students echoed the sentiments of the statement published by A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students’ statement encouraged “immediate preventative action,” labeling such incidents as part of “an ever-growing tide of terrorist threats against students, staff, and faculty both here and at campuses across the United States.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement expressed a need for change through a demand for “Nazi symbols” to be considered a terrorist act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We insist that campus and union officials publicly recognize that the act of (uncritically) displaying Nazi symbols is a terrorist act,” the statement added. “Posting violent threats to Jews is racial terrorism that must not be tolerated anywhere, including our campus community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement acknowledged that campus security and department personnel have previously told students to report any “potentially threatening behaviors,” but noted that “there has yet to be any wide announcement to the campus community of the calculated dissemination of Nazi materials or of the sighting of Nazi apparel on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the statement justified its call for action, claiming that “such a warning and a call for action is necessary not only because students, staff, and faculty already vulnerable to violence have a right to know about potential threats… but more so because it is a certainty that someone in the broader community knows the person or persons making these terrorist threats.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement said there should be an institutional response centered on the well being and safety of UCSB students and employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An institutional response would have “the potential to prevent or at least minimize the severity of any future attack,” according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The statement in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean On Me is a national nonprofit organization that “automatically and anonymously matches peers to create texting networks of instantaneous support,” according to the organization’s <a href=\"https://lean0n.me/\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rushali Kothari, a third-year biological sciences major, founded UCSB’s chapter this past fall quarter and now serves as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a 24/7, anonymous, peer-to-peer support text line. Anyone can text in at any time, and a trained student supporter will respond,” Kothari said. “It’s just a way to vent, or if you need to get something off your chest and you feel like you can’t go to anyone else, this is very easy and accessible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kothari heard about Lean On Me from a friend at another university and decided to bring the organization to UCSB. UCSB is the first UC to have a Lean On Me chapter, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The national organization handled the logistical end of setting up the hotline, Kothari said. Kothari and the rest of Lean On Me’s executive board act as the people “on the ground” who publicize the hotline and help train the student supporters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Lean On Me chapter spent the second half of Winter Quarter and the first half of Spring Quarter recruiting the 18 student supporters who are responsible for responding to the texts that are sent to the hotline. The application process involved both an online application and an interview. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student supporter went through a four-hour online training session provided by the national organization, along with a three-hour in-person workshop led by Lean On Me executive board members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The online training was a lot about empathy and vulnerability and just being open to listening to people,” Kothari said. “The workshop training was more hands-on. We went through a lot of different scenarios.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main two things are validating responses and validating how a person feels and how you do that, and then asking open-ended questions. Let the person… tell you what they want to tell you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The training also involved educating the student supporters about other resources in the local area so that they are able to refer people who text the hotline to those resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have systems in place if something does seem very serious… they’d alert the national team and get the person’s phone number if they’re in danger and then we can give that phone number to UCPD to get the person help if need be,” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone texts the hotline, they have to agree to a list of terms and conditions before a student supporter can reach out to them. 30 people have texted the hotline since its launch on Monday, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people were just testing it out the first day. The text was like ‘hey, I’m just testing this out to see if it’s real,’ and we’d be like ‘yeah, it’s real, it’s working, you’ve got us!’” Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people have been using it for what it’s meant for, whether they’re stressed, they have mild mental health issues, eating disorders, family grief, whatever it might be, and we’re here to help.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Talbert, a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, is one of the 18 student supporters. She has exchanged texts with two people since the hotline’s launch on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main point is to make sure they know that there’s a lot of resources out there and that this is a good starting point if they need to go further, and if not, this is a good place to just… talk it out, basically,” Talbert said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some text conversations have lasted more than a day, while some are as short as 30 minutes, according to Kothari. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To publicize the hotline, Lean On Me has been tabling in the Arbor and plans to put up flyers around campus and Isla Vista soon, Kothari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lean On Me also wants to form partnerships with Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and UCSB Health &amp; Wellness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has a lot of their own problems and their own things that they’re dealing with and sometimes it’s not easy to tell a friend or find someone to help you,” Kothari said. “C.A.P.S. is a great resource for sure but it can’t handle such a large school and the large amount of students that we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hotline’s number is (805) 874-5888.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article said there were 12 student supporters. There are actually 18 student supporters total, as the 6 members of the executive board are also student supporters. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

routes in Santa Barbara and Goleta to improve the timing and efficiency of routes. The line 28 adjustments were drafted by Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and UC Santa Barbara and are scheduled to come into effect on Aug. 19.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding another bus to line 28 will allow buses to pass by every 10 minutes instead of the current 15-minute intervals, according to Hillary Blackerby, interim planning and marketing manager for SBMTD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line 28 was established in August 2016 as part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>. The plan details campus development up to 2025 through changes in programs, transportation and housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB funds the operation of the shuttle. The quarterly lock-in student fee of $13.13 is based on enrollment in UCSB and allows students to ride the bus for free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby approached the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) at its April 23 meeting as part of SBMTD’s annual April outreach to inform the board of the proposed bus route changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby noted buses are often filled to capacity along El Colegio Road due to the high amount of students headed toward campus. Many of these students are what she describes as “line-neutral.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t care which [bus] you get on because you know whichever one you get on, it’s going to wind up at campus,” Blackerby said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When people are really just trying to get to campus, they’re filling up lines that have destinations past campus, like downtown.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buses headed toward campus are filled to capacity and exclude people farther down El Colegio as a consequence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 60-foot segmented buses with a standing load of 110 people were originally purchased for line 15x, but instead became used for line 28 due to higher demand. Even now, these buses are still reaching capacity and leaving people behind, according to Blackerby.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She hopes the additional line 28 bus will relieve the overcrowding problems on other El Colegio buses, such as lines 7, 11 and 24x.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
