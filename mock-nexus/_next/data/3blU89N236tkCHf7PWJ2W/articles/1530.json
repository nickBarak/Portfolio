The Gauchos fell to UC Riverside on Friday by a score of 3-2 before dropping a close one to UC Irvine on Sunday by a score of 2-1.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the pair of losses, the Gauchos now sit with an overall record of 8-7-2 and a conference record of 2-4. UC Riverside improves their overall record to 7-6-3 with a Big West record of 2-3-1. UC Irvine stands at 5-7-3 overall with a conference record of 1-2-1 after splitting games with UCSB and Cal Poly this weekend.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Friday’s match started slowly as both sides seemed to be feeling the other out through the first 30 minutes of play. However, in the 34th minute, UC Riverside kicked off the scoring with a goal from junior midfielder Alexa Bustamante.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The lead would come to be short lived as UCSB fired right back and scored in the 36th minute. Sophomore center midfielder Sara Feder took a free kick from 22 yards out and put the ball in the back of the net. The unassisted goal was number five in the season for Feder.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos would strike again in the first half, as sophomore midfield/forward McKinsey Martinez struck the ball from the right side and scored in the 37th minute of play.

Junior forward Tyler Cunningham took a shot that was blocked, but the deflection went right to freshman defender Christina Tucker who put it away for her first goal of the season.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos were outshot 9-16 and produced only one corner kick throughout the entire match. Junior goalkeeper Beth Ritter tallied six saves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following the defeat, UCSB headed to Irvine where they would suffer another close loss. The match was scoreless through the first half of play, although both teams combined for 12 shots.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">UC Irvine opened up the scoring in the second half as freshman forward Kiana Palacios received a pass from junior forward/midfielder Clarissa Robles in the 48th minute of play. Palacios would put the goal away for her fourth of the season.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos would come back to tie the game in the 75th minute off a score from senior midfield/forward Madison Beckley. Beckley would receive a pass from Feder on the right side of the box and strike the net to tie the game at 1-1.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The game would remain tied until UC Irvine put them up in the last minute of regular time. After two dribbles along the end line, Palacios found senior midfield/forward Bianca Frontino who turned into the box and struck the game-winning goal.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">UCSB was outshot 8-16 and managed only a single corner kick once again. Ritter collected three saves in the match.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos will head to Cal Poly for their next game on Sunday at noon.</span></p>\n<div

women’s soccer team as it played its first home game of the year versus the San Jose State Spartans. Learning from last Sunday’s tough loss at USF, an early goal put the Gauchos in a favorable position until San Jose State answered with a first half goal of its own, sending the game into extra minutes and finishing in a 1-1 tie. UCSB remains winless with an overall record of 0-2-1 as the draw gives San Jose State a 1-1-1 overall record.</p>\n<p>The match was ignited by the Gauchos aggressive play in the game’s first 45 minutes. At the 11:16 mark, a Spartan loose ball was gathered by freshman forward Mallory Hromatko, who then pushed it down the right side of the field until she booted it in the upper left corner of the goalpost. Hromatko tallied in her first career score and snapped UCSB’s two-game goal drought.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Before this game I told myself I need to take people one on one more,” Hromatko said. “I just put my head down and went towards the goal and it all worked out.”</p>\n<p>However, as the game neared its 28<sup>th</sup> minute, the Spartans responded with a goal of their own. Freshman forward Darriell Franklin managed to sneak in a score toward the bottom left corner of the goalpost. While a front line of UCSB defenders seemed ready for the attack, a precise assist from junior midfielder Maricruz Chapa helped set up Franklin for the score. Franklin collected the pass on the right-hand side of the box, and despite a diving effort from senior goal keeper Beth Ritter, Franklin evened the game at a score of 1-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ urgent play carried over into the game’s second half, but they were unable to capitalize on their shots on goal. Sophomore forward Amanda Ball fought for loose balls as her physical play helped weaken San Jose’s defense. Her one shot towards the post could have sealed the win, but Ball’s attempt shanked just left of the goal with three minutes remaining in regulation leading to overtime.</p>\n<p>“Offensively we did well, but we just need more work ethic up top connecting on passes with each other and working as a team,” Ball said.</p>\n<p>With ten minutes added to the game clock, both teams battled for possession of the ball at both ends of the field. After a yellow card was called on freshman midfielder Sydney Magnin, tensions continued to rise as chippy play increased heading into double overtime. Although two corner kicks put UCSB in great field position, the Gauchos could not take advantage of the scoring opportunities, ending with a 1-1 draw in their first match at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“We only scored one goal in 110 minutes so unfortunately that’s not enough, Stumpf said. “We still have another big step to take.”</p>\n<p>UCSB and SJSU combined for a total of 12 shots on goal in the 110 minutes of play. Five yellow cards and 37 fouls were called on the field during Friday’s match as each team evidently made its presence known.</p>\n<p>A total of eight UCSB freshmen saw action against the Spartans, while four from the group played in the last two series of each overtime.</p>\n<p>“We have so many young players getting important experience early on,” Stumpf said. “Those four freshmen were great during overtime and they’re going to get nothing but better going forward.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shift their focus onto their next match on Friday, Sept. 4th as they will host the Texas Longhorns. Kickoff will begin at 7:00 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-30/double-overtime-showdown-concludes-with-tie/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-30/double-overtime-showdown-concludes-with-tie/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-30/double-overtime-showdown-concludes-with-tie/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-30/double-overtime-showdown-concludes-with-tie/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-30/double-overtime-showdown-concludes-with-tie/","id":1528,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1527,1526,1525],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Women’s Soccer Heats Up During Return To Harder","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Soccer_Dustin-Harris_for-10.20.2014-03.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/W-Soccer_Dustin-Harris_for-10.20.2014-03.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos' end winless streak with back-to-back victories in Harder Stadium","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>To say it was an important weekend is an understatement for UCSB’s women’s soccer team.

Coming into the match with an overall record of 1-1-1, the Longhorns size was a major obstacle for a much smaller UCSB team. But, the Gauchos were not afraid to battle for each possession and made their attacks in the front line count.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Mallory Hromatko was the main distributor for the Gauchos offensive attack. She consistently found her teammates around the goal box and racked up two assists along with one shot on goal. In the 57<sup>th</sup> minute, Hromatko advanced the ball toward the right side of the field making an in-and-out move on a Longhorn defender and crossed the ball to the middle of the field for an easy score by freshman forward Jessica Parque. Parque’s first career goal gave UCSB a 1-0 advantage coming out of the second half.</p>\n<p>“This was the first time [me and Mallory] got to play a lot of minutes together, but we built a natural connection tonight,” Parque said.</p>\n<p>A similar opportunity appeared for the Gauchos in the 86<sup>th</sup> minute as Hromatko made her attack past a Texas defender toward goal. Working the ball down the right wing of the field, Hromatko made a quality cross to sophomore midfielder Chace Schorstein who popped the ball over Texas goalkeeper Abby Smith in for the score. This was Schorstein’s first goal on the year and third of her career.</p>\n<p>“This week during practice we really focused on connecting with the forwards, something we were missing in our previous matches,” Hromatko commented. “I feel like tonight was our breakout game with that.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos maintained control of the match following this point. While Texas outhit the Gauchos in total shots for the game, 11 shots to eight, a couple quality saves from Caginia sealed the deal and helped UCSB to its first win of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Caginia finished the night with four saves behind goal, all in the second half, including one diving save in the 59<sup>th</sup> minute of play off a header from Texas midfielder Kayra Dollas.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to come out strong against a good Texas team and show them that UCSB could hang with them,” Hromatko said.</p>\n<p>Sunday afternoon was another test for UCSB as Head Coach Randy Dedini and his Sacramento State team traveled to Harder Stadium. Coming off of a 3-2 win against CSU Bakersfield, the Hornets entered Santa Barbara with a 1-3 overall record, but liked their chances against an inexperienced UCSB team. Yet, it was the Gauchos’ young talent that proved to be the “x-factor” during the game’s early stages.</p>\n<p>UCSB struck first in the 17<sup>th</sup> minute off a corner kick connection from junior midfielder Dakota Griggs to Hromatko. Griggs served a perfect ball to the middle of the box as Hromatko climbed over two Hornet defenders sending a header shot into the right side of the goal post. UCSB had a 1-0 advantage until junior forward Adaurie Dayak scored the equalizer in the game’s 34<sup>th</sup> minute. Launching the ball 20 yards out to the upper right corner of the goal past a diving effort from Caginia, she gave Sac State a momentous 1-1 tie heading into the half.</p>\n<p>As the second half approached, the Gauchos took advantage of every early opportunity and eventually caught the Hornets off guard. Barely two minutes into the second half, UCSB’s Parque snagged a loose ball 20 yards out of the box and fired a shot past redshirt freshman goalkeeper Destiny Butcher to the upper right hand corner. Parque’s second goal of the weekend snapped a 1-1 tie and put UCSB back on top, 2-1.</p>\n<p>“We told our girls they would have a few more looks than Sac State in the second half and luckily our first opportunity went in which took a some pressure off and made all the difference for us,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>In the 72<sup>nd</sup> minute, Stumpf made a lineup change that moved senior Angelisa Cortez to the forward position in place of Hromatko. Beating her defender off the dribble, Cortez delivered a shot to the right corner of the box similar to Parque’s goal, giving the Gauchos some insurance and increasing their lead to 3-1.</p>\n<p>“Our team did a good job keeping the ball and wearing Sac State down to finally get that third goal a bit late,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s two wins over the weekend improved its overall record to 2-2-1. The Gauchos have built some solid chemistry these past couple of games and are currently on a two-game winning streak. But with a packed roster of 34 players, Stumpf hopes his players can keep their cohesiveness throughout the regular season.</p>\n<p>“We have 34 girls on the team and not everybody gets to play,” Stumpf said. “Do they deserve to play?

The California native has been on fire, having scored five goals and 11 points, both second-best marks on the team, over the last nine games. She scored the team’s only goal against CSUN, resulting in the 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>Along with the freshman, the Gauchos will also hope for the reemergence of senior Amanda Ball.</p>\n<p>The forward started the season hot with eight goals in the team’s first 10 matches of the season, but she has fallen flat over the last five game, having not scored and being held to just two assists.</p>\n<p>Defenses have definitely been heavily pressuring the Chino Hills native.</p>\n<p>Before her five-game non-scoring streak, she had kicked one through the back of the net in four consecutive outings.</p>\n<p>Even with that, Ball’s eight goals still earns her the top spot in the Big West, along with her 18 total points. She will need to be at the top of her game against a Hawaii squad that isn’t playing great but is still capable.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Rainbow Wahine played Big West best UC Irvine and lost 3-2, meaning they won’t be such an easy win if the Gauchos don’t come out firing.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will hope to rely on leading scorer Sonest Furtado. The senior forward also leads the team in points (11) and assists (3).</p>\n<p>In reality, if Hawaii hopes for an upset win over Santa Barbara, then it will need to come out strong and fast.</p>\n<p>So far this season the Rainbow Wahine outscored 8-3 in first halves and have been shut out in six of their 13 total games.</p>\n<p>The team will need to rely upon Furtado, but she will also need help from whoever can provide it on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>Wahine goalkeeper Alexis Mata has been one bright spot on a defense that has given up 17 goals this season.</p>\n<p>The junior’s 60 saves rank second best in the Big West, while her 78 percent save rate ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>After Hawaii, the Gauchos come back home with a tough test against Long Beach State, a team that has bested UCSB in its last seven meetings.</p>\n<p>LBSU defeated Hawaii in its conference opener 2-0 but has since struggled, earning a tie with rival UC Irvine and being knocked off by CSUF at home, where it had only lost once this season before, 2-0.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Gauchos, whose top goal scorers rank way above the rest of the team, the Beach has scored 16 goals on the season, but no one player has scored more than three individually.</p>\n<p>In fact, only one, senior forward Tori Bolden, has three nets this season while the next five players have two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>This has played to the Beach’s advantage, as it has consistently found the back of the net in games, being shut out in just four contests this year, including a match against No. 18 California.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, this week has become the most critical for UCSB.</p>\n<p>A slow start is not a killer, but if it bleeds into the middle of the season, then Santa Barbara has no hope of making the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>With three of UCSB’s key players being seniors, chances are they will try everything they can to right the ship and go out on top in their final season.<br>\nSanta Barbara takes on Hawaii at 10 p.m. PST on Thursday, Oct. 12, at Waipi’o Peninsula Soccer Stadium. It will then host LBSU at 1 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 15, at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.
