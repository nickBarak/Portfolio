CP started out the season 0-4 before winning five straight before again becoming owners of a four-game losing streak which leads them to its 6-7 overall record.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Saturday’s game is not a must-win. However, it missed an opportunity to take a bigger lead in the conference standings with that loss to UC Davis, falling into a three-way tie for first place in the North with the Aggies and the Hornets, after they beat Cal Poly, meaning there is not much room for error with just two weeks left before tournament time.</p>\n<p>UCSB owns its Blue-Green rivalry with Cal Poly with an impressive 48-18-9 record against their fierce competitor. Normally, a record that lopsided would not give reason to support the notion this is the most impressive rivalry in college soccer, but the last few years would beg to differ.</p>\n<p>Over the last 10 years, the two squads have gone on to play some intense matches, with the record being 8-6-6 in favor of UCSB. Cal Poly is the only team to sweep the season series in the last 10 years as well, accomplishing the feat just once during the 2012-13 season. That also marks the last time CP has defeated UCSB in Harder in the past 19 years.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Santa Barbara has only won five of its ten home games over the past decade, with the last three games here at Harder Stadium ending in ties. UCSB, however, did take the victory at Cal Poly last year to win the season series.</p>\n<p>Not only has the great play helped increase the tenacity of the rivalry, but also the attendance, especially at Harder Stadium, has helped take this game to the next level.</p>\n<p>Last season’s attendance peaked at 11,424, the highest attended game in the NCAA in 2016 and in 2014, and the match reached 14, 919 fans in the Stadium, making it the second largest campus crowd in NCAA history, excluding playoffs.</p>\n<p>Getting to the game, the advantage seems to be with the home side despite the loss yesterday. Before that, the Gauchos were on fire, winning five of their last six games with their only non-win being a tie at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Before being scored on three times by Davis, freshman goalkeeper Adam Carrillo was on a roll, allowing just four goals in his previous six starts, and earning his second Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors last week for helping the Gauchos go 1-0-1.</p>\n<p>Even taking into account the three goals against the Aggies, Carrillo still holds the best goals-against average in the entire Big West at 1.05. His 40 saves rank fifth in the conference.<br>\nAnother freshman grabbing the headlines in Santa Barbara is Randy Michael. The forward has UCSB’s most consistent offensive player leading the team in goals (5), assists (4), and total points (14). His 14 points also rank fourth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Michael is also the only other Gaucho this season to win a Big West award. He won Offensive Player of the Week honors during the week of Sept. 28, after helping the Gauchos earn two victories against conference foes with two assists and two goals.</p>\n<p>Since conference play has started, Michael has earned nine of his total 14 points in these important matches with three goals and three assists.</p>\n<p>In the five Big West games UCSB has played, as a team, it ranks second in goals (10), assists (11) and points (31) while also shooting the second-highest percentage (.15).</p>\n<p>One of the keys for Cal Poly to earn a victory at Harder Stadium will be importance of starting the game off fast. This season CP has been outscored in the first half of games 11-8, but have bounced back to outscore opponents in the second half 6-5.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but its defense needs to limit the Gauchos opportunities, which is something it has not done much of, as they’ve been outshot 181-119 over the course of the season.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will likely rely on goalkeeper Simon Boehme, whose 59 saves currently serves as the best mark in the Big West. The junior has allowed the fifth least goals in the conference, 15, and his .79 save percentage is a conference best.</p>\n<p>Boehme has also only allowed 15 goals on the season despite his team giving up the most shots. The 15 goals allowed is the fifth most in the Big West and his 1.24 goals allowed per game ranks fourth.</p>\n<p>Two players on Cal Poly’s side are tied for the team lead in goals (3). However, senior defender Adam Olsen will be sidelined during Saturday’s action due to earning a red card in Wednesday’s game.</p>\n<p>This means junior forward Sean Goode will have to try to carry the offensive flow against the Gauchos. Goode scored a goal against Sac State.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Diego Alonso will look to help his junior counterpart out as he leads the team in assists with four on the year, also tying him for the fourth best mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The rekindling of rivalries is always a special time in sports, especially at the collegiate level. No matter the sport, an intense rivalry game, a roarous crowd and a great stadium are always a great recipe for a wonderful evening. Especially for the students who will look to throw their tortillas Saturday Night.</p>\n<p>The Blue-Green rivalry will be renewed at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 14 at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

The 10 total points are actually worse than Cal Poly’s 2016 point total, where the team had 11.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs have not been back to the playoffs since 2015 and appear to have a lot of work to do in order to get back.</p>\n<p>Despite the final score, it was actually freshman Rodney Michael who opened up the scoring for the game, giving the Gauchos the early 1-0 lead on a 15 yard shot from the top of the box.</p>\n<p>The goal was Michael’s eighth on the season, increasing his team lead in goals on the year. Michael’s scoring shot was the first UCSB since the Oct. 18 match against Sacramento State where Michael again scored all two goals of the match for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were offensively active, taking six shots in the first half, but only Michael’s was able to find the net.</p>\n<p>The play between the two teams was back and forth during the first half, much like the last meeting between the two familiar clubs.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 43rd minute when sophomore Kenneth Higgins received a heads-up pass from teammate Jared Pressley and took a shot that went just to the left of a diving Alan Carrillo.</p>\n<p>The point was not only the Mustang’s first of the match, but it was also Higgins’ first goal of the season and the equalizer left it all even at halftime, 1-1.</p>\n<p>If the story at the end of the first half was yet another Cal Poly &amp; UCSB draw, the Mustangs were quick to change that as less than four minutes from the beginning of the second half, senior Adam Olsen found himself at the far post when the ball deflected towards him and the senior was able to tap the ball into the net for the lead, 2-1.</p>\n<p>Olsen’s mark on the match was not left at the eventual game-winning goal, as the senior lobbed a high arcing pass to a waiting Kaba Alkebulan in the 51st minute, who ran past a defender to find himself alone in the box, who headed it past Carrillo, putting Cal Poly ahead 3-1.

Ball seems to be in great shape to continue her great run this season as she scored one of the goals in the exhibition against North Texas. Both she and junior midfielder Mallory Hromatko were named to the Big West Preseason All-Conference Team.</p>\n<p>Ball’s fellow seniors on the team, defender Kate Shoemaker, and midfielder Chace Schornstein are all poised to have a big season and, hopefully, finish their careers with a Big West championship.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors are playing very well right now, and they will be a big part of our lineup,” Stumpf said. “They’re all playing at the top of their game and I am really excited about them.”</p>\n<p>Despite all the good news out of the Santa Barbara camp right now, Idaho will not be an easy foe for UCSB to open its’ season against.</p>\n<p>The Vandals are coming off a very successful 2016-17 campaign in which they won their second consecutive Big Sky Regular Season Championship and won 10-plus games for just the fourth time in program history.</p>\n<p>Idaho was upset in the semifinal of the Big Sky Tournament losing to Eastern Washington 1-0 after allowing the game-deciding goal in the 88<sup>th</sup> minute. It was the Vandals only conference loss of the season.</p>\n<p>2017-18 will be tougher on Idaho who is replacing its top four-goal scorers from a year ago, however, mid-season transfers junior goalkeeper Makayla Presgrave and junior forward Bridget Daley hope to make the biggest impact.</p>\n<p>“They have had a lot of success over the last couple of years as a program because they really went to work on the defensive side of things with a drop and counter conceding very few goals so I expect to see something similar to that,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>These preseason games don’t mean much to the Gauchos in terms of postseason hopes. UCSB will only make the postseason, in most cases, by winning the Big West championship.</p>\n<p>Because of that, an 8-0 start to the season isn’t necessary nor should it be expected with the tough preseason Santa Barbara has lined up for themselves, however, the lessons that can be learned in these games are very important heading into conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s super important to build off these games and build confidence but interestingly enough, I almost feel like a loss here or there will take the pressure off,” Stumpf said. “We want to win every game we can but that’s just not going to happen especially two years in a row but we hope to have a balanced record and be as prepared as we can for Big West play.”</p>\n<p>UCSB opens its season against Idaho at 7 p.m. on Friday, August 18 at Harder Stadium. The Gauchos will be on the road for the next five matches so catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

irritated Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg had vowed that, no matter what, the team would come back stronger next season and that they would use that feeling of anguish and uselessness as extra motivation in the seven months to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following their 7-0 dismantling of Westmont Aug. 18, it would be difficult to argue with Vom Steeg’s assertion. This year’s Gauchos, picked to finish second in the Big West behind only Cal State Fullerton, look poised to bounce back strong from last season’s disappointment due to several key new acquisitions as well as nine returning starters from last season’s team.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Santa Barbara was shackled by its lack of finesse in the final third, scoring only 18 goals in 19 games. In an effort to bolster the attack, UCSB acquired junior transfer Thibault Candia, a pacey striker who led Temple last season with six goals. Candia already looked to be in mid-season form against Westmont, contributing two goals and chipping in two assists. He also displayed solid chemistry with junior Ignacio Tellechea, a returning starter who looks to better the four goals he scored last year for the squad. With the addition of freshman Carter Clemmensen, the Arizona Gatorade player of the year last season, UCSB should easily top its goal total from last season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midfield, Santa Barbara returns two studs: sophomore Rodney Michael and junior captain Noah Billingsley. Billingsley struggled with injuries last season but was a key cog of the lineup when healthy. When he started, the Gauchos had a 5-1-4 record, but the team went just 1-6-1 when Billingsley was unable to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael was one of the lone bright spots for UCSB last season, leading the team in both goals and assists en-route to a spot on the all-conference team as a freshman. With another year of training under his belt — as well as experience playing for the U-20 Sierra Leone national team — Michael will once again provide an offensive threat for Santa Barbara on the wing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB was sound on defense last season, the additions of sophomore Carson Vom Steeg and junior Faouzi Taieb should make the side’s back line even more dominate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vom Steeg, the son of Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, played for Stanford last year, appearing in 18 games for a side that went on to win the national championship. While he was unable to play in the exhibition match due to injury, Vom Steeg will immediately improve the organization and shape of the Gauchos’ back line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taieb, a transfer from St. Francis who was named the NEC defensive player of the year last season, showed his worth immediately in the exhibition match, leading a back line that didn’t allow a shot on goal in the entire 90 minutes. Taieb was also named to the MAC HERMANN award watch list — a list that highlights the top 75 players in the country heading into the season. If the two can get on the same page, the Gauchos should have arguably the most formidable back line in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB won’t have any grace period for their new players to get acclimated, as their first match of the season comes against St. John’s, a historically strong program that has already topped a top-25 team in the preseason. The other biggest tests in the off-season for Santa Barbara will come against Butler and UCLA, both in September. The Bulldogs were selected to finish second in the Big East conference, and before last season, the Bruins had made 34 consecutive NCAA tournaments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conference play, the Gauchos will take on last season’s Big West champion, Cal State Fullerton, at home on Oct. 6, and they will finish off the regular season at home Oct. 27 against Cal Poly in the traditional Blue-green rivalry game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an abundance of talent and the hunger to leave last season’s blemish in the past, this UCSB squad has all of the tools necessary to challenge for the Big West title this season.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.
