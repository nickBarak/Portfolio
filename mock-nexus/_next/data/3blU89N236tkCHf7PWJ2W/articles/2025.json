Instead, he has remained composed and seems to be committed to improving the future of the NFL. Three rules concerning the distance of the Point After Touchdown, known as the “P.A.T.,” and two-point conversion regulations were adjusted.</p>\n<p>The P.A.T. will no longer be kicked from the two-yard line, but will now be attempted from the 15-yard line. Formerly a 20-yard kicking try, the change in range now sets kickers up with a 32-yard extra-point attempt.</p>\n<p>Still, this adjustment is not a definite change as its success within actual game situations has yet to be tested. The restructuring of the P.A.T. will start off as a one-year trial. Depending on its impact, owners will have the chance to vote for or against the rule in the NFL’s following offseason.</p>\n<p>Finally joining college football in use of the same rule, defenses can now return turnovers that occur during an offense’s two-point conversion attempt for a score of two-points. Since the addition of the two-point conversion to the NFL in 1994, a turnover always resulted in a dead play with no points for the defense. Unchanged is the distance of the two-point conversion as it will remain on the two-yard line.</p>\n<p>Since the two-point conversion is already a short distance away from the end zone, this rule is not problematic. Promoting the use of the two-point conversion should attract more football fans, but making the play easier could potentially become a standard score for offenses.</p>\n<p>While other rule proposals await for team owners to discuss and settle on, these new changes are encouraging in the NFL’s progression.</p>\n<p>The change in the P.A.T. will definitely increase the entertainment level of the sport as kickers will face a more challenging 32-yard attempt. Prior to this rule change, the 20-yard point after effort was a routine score that usually was followed with a commercial.</p>\n<p>The P.A.T. not being an automatic extra point after a team scores a touchdown will make games more intriguing. It forces coaches to make gutsier play calls in crucial, sometimes win or lose situations which allows the game to become more enjoyable for fans.</p>\n<p>Kickers may not appreciate extending the P.A.T. distance now, but it elevates the importance of their position. Kickers are commonly underappreciated due to the fact that they can be replaced so easily, especially when scoring an extra point from the two-yard line is such an effortless task.</p>\n<p>Moving the P.A.T. to the 32-yard line makes the point after attempt more appealing as it increases the amount of pressure on the kicker. It is a chance for kickers to remind everyone of their importance on the field.</p>\n<p>We have all known the two-point conversion attempt to be an unexpected, surprise play call. With these rule changes, does this mean that the anticipation of two-point conversions will possibly detract from its spontaneity? Without a conclusive answer, we will all have to wait and see if the change will help or hurt the game.</p>\n<p>Certainly, giving defenses the opportunity to score off of failed two-point conversion attempts may be the greatest adjustment made. It enhances the intensity of late-game situations in which defenses gain the chance of being game changers. Which is only acceptable since “defense wins championships,” right?</p>\n<p>Imagine a return of an interception, fumble recovery or blocked field goal attempt of a two-point conversion try being the difference in a team winning or sending a game into overtime. These are the types of bizarre scenarios that have given college football a slight entertainment advantage over the NFL. Giving defenses the chance to benefit from causing turnovers is another possibility for the NFL to become more amusing.</p>\n<p>Although many blame Commissioner Goodell for a lack of professionalism and responsibility during the 2014 NFL season, the NFL and NFLPA’s effort to improve the game of football is refreshing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 28,

That may be the oldest sports cliché in the book; however, it has rung true over and over again as the teams that are playing their best come playoff time tend to fare well and make it the farthest. That trend has not been consistent in the 2015 NHL Playoffs as the season-long juggernauts have flexed their muscles and knocked out some of the hottest teams in the league like the Minnesota Wild and the Ottawa Senators. While the Ducks and the Blackhawks have already wrapped things up out west, the Eastern conference remains up for grabs as the Capitals and the Rangers will need game seven and Carey Price is willing the Canadiens back into Montreal’s series after falling behind 3-0 to Tampa Bay.  Recap:</p>\n<p><b>Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers (Tied 3-3)</b>– Alexander Ovechkin put the Capitals on his back this series and carried them to a 3-1 lead over the Rangers. That is when the offense clicked and a Henrik Lundqvist with his back against the wall is a dangerous Henrik Lundqvist. Two straight wins have tied the series and brought it back to New York for a pivotal game seven. There are so many different factors that will affect Wednesday’s game and it will ultimately become a battle of who shows up and who does not. Braden Holtby has been vulnerable in the last two games, allowing six goals over that span while his offense has provided him only three goals of support; none of those from Alex Ovechkin. While Alex Ovechkin and Henrik Lundqvist headline this series, I believe that it will be up to Braden Holtby and the Capitals defense to shut down the Rangers if they want to have any chance of moving on.</p>\n<p><b>Anaheim Ducks vs. Calgary Flames (Ducks win 4-1)-</b> The Ducks seem to be on a mission this postseason as they overpowered the Flames with size and experience to cruise to a 4-1 series victory. This series taught us a lot about both Anaheim and Calgary. We learned that Anaheim has the depth and high-octane offense to make a serious charge at Chicago next round and reach the Stanley Cup. We also learned that Calgary may not have had the firepower to win this year, but they will be back and back with a vengeance. Johnny Gaudreau looked poised and dangerous after being benched in the second period of game two and the sky is the limit for the rookie. Not to mention its hard not to imagine what this team could have done with a healthy Mark Giordano. Anaheim Head Coach Bruce Boudreau has already pegged Chicago “the fastest team in the NHL”, which is going to test the versatile defense of the Ducks. If Frederik Andersen can match Corey Crawford in goal then the Ducks have a serious chance to take this series.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Nbk86c29uI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><b>Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota Wild (Blackhawks win 4-0)- </b>Just a few weeks ago, no one in their right mind would have chosen Corey Crawford to beat Devan Dubnyk in a goalie battle; however, that was the case in this series as it was all Blackhawks all the time. Crawford was magnificent all series and after being benched in the opening series for Chicago, he made the most of this opportunity giving up only seven goals in four games to a high-powered Minnesota offense. The Wild deserve all the credit in the world for even making it to where they did, as no one expected them to make a charge into the postseason, let alone defeat Stanley Cup favorites St. Louis. That is exactly what Mike Yeo did and with a historic second half of the season for Devan Dubnyk, the Wild were able to dominate the NHL and rapidly climb up the standings. Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville has not been shy in praising the talented Anaheim Ducks and knows that his team will have their hands full in the next round. Patrick Kane is playing like the best player in the posteason right now and if he keeps scoring at his current pace, no one will be able to stop Chicago.</p>\n<p><b>Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Montreal Canadiens (Tampa Bay 3-2)</b>-Fresh off of a bruising seven game series against Detroit, no one expected Tampa Bay to come out and play the way they did against Montreal. The Canadiens had far more rest and still found themselves behind 3-0 to the Lightning and scrambling for answers. Carey Price has been the answer for this team all season long and he has responded with two great games to keep Montreal afloat. The offense of the Canadiens cannot be overlooked as they have scored eight goals in their last two games and seem to be putting things together at the right time. Is it too little too late though? Steven Stamkos and the deadly offense of the Lightning will look to stop their mini-skid and move on to the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday. I believe that the Lightning will wrap it up at home, but if they take it to game seven then they will be in a bad position playing on the road with very little momentum.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63324\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63324\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-12/nhl-playoffs-getting-hot-at-the-right-time/","id":2024,"author":{"id":321,"name":"Jack Mathews"},"related":[2023,2022,2021],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ovechkin, Holtby Dazzle as Washington Gives the Rangers All That They Can Handle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/game-4-capitals-3-rangers-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/game-4-capitals-3-rangers-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Jack Mathews continues breaking down this NHL Playoffs.

As the Divisional round of the NHL playoffs began this week, the battle for the Stanley Cup grew more and more fierce as rivals were pitted against each other in all four series. Out west, the Ducks and the Blackhawks continue to flex their muscles as both teams hold a 2-0 series lead over their opponents. The Eastern conference has been much less one-sided as Tampa Bay currently holds a 2-0 series lead, but required double overtime to beat the Canadiens in game 1. The Capitals and the Rangers have provided the most entertaining series thus far and the heroics of Braden Holtby have led Washington to a 2-1 series lead.<br>\n<strong>Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers (2-1 Capitals)</strong>– Wow. This series has the feel of a Stanley Cup finals and it is only three games in. Alex Ovechkin has been lights out just like he has been all season and may have had the goal of the year in their 3-2 loss to the Rangers in game two. Hats off to Braden Holtby who has outplayed his counterpart Henrik Lundqvist so far, including a masterful 30 save shutout in the Capitals 1-0 victory on Monday. New York’s offense has been their only question mark this postseason and those questions are becoming more and more prevalent as they have only mustered four goals in three games so far and seem to be relying a bit too heavily on their top-notch goaltending.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2pjERKAc_8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span><br>\n<strong>Anaheim Ducks vs. Calgary Flames (2-0 Ducks)</strong>– Calgary has been this years Cinderella story in the NHL playoffs, but it looks like their run may come to abrupt end if the Ducks keep playing the way that they are. Anaheim cruised to a 6-1 victory over the Flames in game one and Calgary goaltender Jonas Hiller did not even make it out of the first period against his former team. Frederik Andersen has solidified himself as the Ducks top goaltender and is playing like he wants the Stanley Cup, giving up only one goal over the first two games of the series. Anaheim is the only undefeated team in the postseason and the farther they advance, the more advantageous all of their rest will be. Calgary needs to work some of their magic at home to have any chance of advancing as Jiri Hudler, Johnny Gaudreau, and Sean Monahan have all been held without a point through two games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Chicago Blackhawks vs. Minnesota Wild (2-0 Blackhawks)</strong>– Devan Dubnyk has been another feel-good story this season as his play in net has propelled Minnesota to an improbable run to the second round of the playoffs. Chicago has scored 8 goals in their first two games, including two beauties from Patrick Kane in the Blackhawks 4-1 victory in game two. Corey Crawford has been back in net and has not been perfect, but has made 30 saves in both victories and has done enough to win with an electric offense in front of him. Minnesota is not out of it yet though as Devan Dubnyk and an electric offense led by Zach Parise will be in desperation mode over the next few days to even this series. That will not be possible if the Wild defenseman are unable to find an answer for the high-octane attack for the Blackhawks. All four lines have potential to put the puck in the net, but All-Star Wild defenseman Ryan Suter and company should be able to neutralize them better at home over the next two games. I believe the depth of Chicago will ultimately be too much for the Wild to win this series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NwYoaT8IX4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span><br>\n<strong>Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Montreal Canadiens (2-0 Lightning)</strong>– This series is a classic case of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object with the offense of Tampa Bay being pitted against likely MVP Carey Price for Montreal. So far it has been all Lightning all the time, as Tampa Bay needed seven games to beat Detroit; however, they have dominated Atlantic division rival Montreal so far. Tyler Johnson has been masterful all postseason and scored his seventh goal of the playoffs in a 2-1 double overtime thriller in game one. Game two was not early as close as the Lightning charged their way to a 6-2 victory at the Bell Centre. Rest has not deterred the Lightning so far and with games three and four in Tampa Bay, this series could ultimately be the most unlikely sweep of them all. Carey Price will bring his best to the table but it is up to the players around him to provide support if the Canadiens have any hopes of moving on.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This was before Sam — a defensive lineman and a leader on the team — knew his name would be listed on NFL draft boards at the season’s end after a breakout year.</p>\n<p>“I came up to my team and told them ‘Hey, I’m Michael Sam, I’m from Hitchcock, Texas, my major is Sport Management, and I’m gay.’ That was the first time I ever said I was gay,” he revealed.</p>\n<p>With that announcement, Sam set himself up for being the first openly gay player drafted into the NFL. Monday at Corwin Pavilion, he discussed his upbringing and coming out process in an event hosted by UCSB Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Growing up as the seventh of eight children in the Southeast Texas town of Hitchcock was not easy for Sam. His family name was synonymous with trouble in the area. Two of his siblings died before he turned six, and one was shot down trying to rob a house. Two more brothers spent time in prison and one went missing in 1998.</p>\n<p>“They abused me daily and got to the point that I wasn’t safe at home,” Sam said of his brothers’ treatment towards him. “So I would always leave my house at odd hours. I would take long walks. It was very difficult for me.”</p>\n<p>His relationship with his parents mimicked a similar disconnect. Sam’s mother did not want him playing sports, leading to discord between the two. His father was in and out of his life. He discussed he originally wanted to come out to his parents at his graduation, but for some reason, backed out.</p>\n<p>When he did finally tell them, Sam had the impression his mother already knew, while his father did not say much. “He just went to the bar and got drunk,” Sam added.</p>\n<p>As he dealt with sexuality in his teen years, Sam found love in college. The image most associated with Sam is with his fiancé, Vito Cammisano, right after the St. Louis Rams drafted him in the final round of the NFL Draft. Cameras captured the couple embracing in a heartwarming hug and kiss. In January, Sam proposed to Vito on the couple’s trip to Rome on the same day as Sam’s birthday.</p>\n<p>Sam and Cammisano’s relationship wasn’t always a love story from the start. In fact, there was dislike for one another when they first met. Sam approached Cammisano at a party his freshman year, asking Cammisano if he was okay after noticing him hunched over almost as if he was about to vomit.</p>\n<p>“I said ‘Hey, are you OK?’ and Vito slowly looked up at me and said ‘Get away from me,’” Sam said. “I lost it. I don’t care who you are, you don’t disrespect me to my face. So I actually didn’t talk to Vito for two years.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until Sam decided to approach Cammisano at a bar that romance between the two ensued.</p>\n<p>“I bought him a drink and put my hand on his back and the rest is history,” Sam told the audience.</p>\n<p>Their relationship, however, took a turn for the worst. Fear of living in a small college town with the pressure of being a star player on the football team made it impossible for Sam to come out publicly; he wasn’t ready.</p>\n<p>Cammisano was already out and grew tired of not being able to be seen in public with Sam. The two broke up because of it.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t go out together, we had to have our friends there and I had to be separated,” Sam said. “Eventually, we started fighting and it got really hard for us. Vito said he couldn’t do this anymore; this isn’t healthy for us.”</p>\n<p>Months passed, but the two got back together and have been with each other ever since. It was Vito who gave Sam the courage to come out. Many felt Sam gambled by coming out right before the draft because of possible discrimination he might face from NFL teams. Nonetheless, the Rams selected him with the 249th pick in the draft.</p>\n<p>While with St. Louis, he acknowledged he never felt excluded because of his sexuality. Instead, teammates treated him like any other rookie, making him carry team equipment and earn his spot on the team.</p>\n<p>It was in his second preseason game where he said he felt part of the team. It was also the same game in which he sacked Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel.</p>\n<p>Although he had a legitimate shot at a roster spot, his time in St. Louis was limited to only the preseason as he was released in the final round of cuts before the start of the season.</p>\n<p>He then bounced to the Dallas Cowboys’ practice squad, where he said teammates Tony Romo, Jason Witten and DeMarco Murray supported him throughout before he was waived.</p>\n<p>Sam is currently a free agent, waiting to get a call from an NFL team. When asked what he thought his chances of playing in the league are, he said he did not know, and is open to playing professionally in the Canadian Football League.</p>\n<p>Before his talk ended, Sam offered some final words of encouragement.</p>\n<p>“If you think you might be alone, someone might disown you, you might not have friends or people are trying to bully you, I say don’t be afraid.” Sam remarked. “… Together we will change the world for the better, for each one of us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 11 of May 7, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63132\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63132\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/michael-sam/","id":2022,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2021,2020,2019],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
