It’s a complete change,” Mead said. “Nevada is like 120 in the summer and here it’s like 70 and you just get to go to the beach all of the time.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Mead has made an immediate impact for the Gauchos, ranking second on the team with three goals, the most recent of which was in Sunday’s victory over Riverside.</p>\n<p>“Indiana was heavily recruited all over the country,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Everybody wanted her and we put her very high on our list. When she told us she was coming, we were just ecstatic.”</p>\n<p>Recruited by other top schools such as Boston College, UCLA and Duke, Mead was intrigued by Santa Barbara’s marine biology program and the potential career choices it presented.</p>\n<p>Soccer, however, was not always Indiana’s main talent, as she competed at the World Tap Dancing Competition in Germany when she was nine, winning three gold medals.</p>\n<p>“I had to choose between soccer and dance and I chose soccer, which got me an education,” Mead said. “Dance — you can only go to Broadway, and I can’t sing, so there is no way I could make it. I think my technique on the ball is the best part of my game and that probably came from tap dancing.”</p>\n<p>Success has been somewhat of a regularity for Mead between her dancing, two state championships on her high school golf team and, most importantly, soccer. Indiana qualified for the U-14 and U-15 national soccer teams for the U.S. before being cut from the squad after her sophomore year.</p>\n<p>“That’s when I had to sit back and think if I really wanted to do this,” Mead said. “Being cut on the national team also really let me live out my high school career. It was almost a blessing.”</p>\n<p>Mead turned that opportunity into a positive, playing for a club team during high school and improving her skills all around.</p>\n<p>“I made the U-18 national team at the end of my senior year,” Mead said. “It was perfect timing. I got to get back on that team after I got to graduate and after I got to go to prom.”</p>\n<p>Currently tied for sixth — and first among freshmen — in the Big West with two goals in conference play, Mead has had to transition to her current forward spot due to depth at her original attacking center midfielder position.</p>\n<p>“Playing forward is a huge change, but my teammates and coach have really helped me learn the position,” Mead said. “Just as long as I get minutes I’d play anywhere — except goalie, I don’t think I could do that one. ”</p>\n<p>Stumpf noted that Indiana’s future with the program is at center midfield, but for now she has made the best of her situation.</p>\n<p>“She’s contributed greatly,” Stumpf said. “She is a very happy young lady, and is very popular among the team. She brings a lot to the table — it’s not just the soccer.”</p>\n<p>A point of concern for Mead when entering UCSB was her defensive skills, something she never really focused on during high school.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, before I came here I was an awful defender,” Mead said. “I didn’t know how to do it, but [Coach Stumpf] has been yelling at me to fix my defense. I’ve just been getting better and learning defensively.”</p>\n<p>While at UCSB, Mead has faced difficulties adjusting to academics just like any other student, but it does not seem like anything this former Boulder City High School valedictorian cannot handle.</p>\n<p>As part of a five-girl freshman recruiting class, Mead figures to be a main component for the Gauchos for the next three years and hopes to play soccer well after college if possible.</p>\n<p>Even when facing challenges, it seems as though Mead can conquer anything that is thrown her way. If she can have as much success for the UCSB soccer team as she has managed to have in her young life already, the Gauchos will be Big West contenders for years to come.</p>\n<p>“She is a very impressive young lady to me,” Stumpf said. “She is a great student, great teammate, great soccer player with very high aspirations. She is just a great kid.”</p>\n<p>Indiana and the rest of the team continue play on Friday when they take on Pacific.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41998\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-18/tap-dance-champ-big-west-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41998\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-18/tap-dance-champ-big-west-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-18/tap-dance-champ-big-west-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-18/tap-dance-champ-big-west-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-18/tap-dance-champ-big-west-success/","id":1669,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1668,1667,1666],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[254,318,354,366,518,519,527,533,535,538,539,546,548,551,554,555,558,561,567,570,574,576,577,578,589,592,594,596,605,609,613,618,623,630,633,638,640,647,650,651,653,654,656,660,661,668,670,673,677,683,694,700,703,706,708,710,717,719,724,727,798,809,814,828,833,847,849,851,853,854,856,857,858,863,867,868,870,874,877,879,880,882,884,886,887,889,892,894,899,900,902,904,905,915,920,1259,1565,1566,1567,1568,1569,1570,1571,1575,1578,1581,1583,1584,1587,1590,1591,1594,1599,1601,1603,1606,1607,1608,1611,1623,1626,1652,1666,1668,1669,1670,1674,1675,1685,1689,1691,1692,1697,1762,1763,1765,2063,2069,2095,2142,2158,3169,3185,3190,3226,3229,3231,3232,3238,3244,3249,3256,4448,4494,4522,4523,4524,4526,4531,4539,4541,4544,4545,4546,4549,4550,4551,4554,4567,5189,5193,5194,5209,5396,5399,5400,5402,5403,5404,5405,5406,5407,5409,5417,5418,5419,5420,5421,5422,5423,5424,5425,5426,5427,5428,5429,5430,5431,5436,5448,5449,5450,5502,5530,5536],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"UCSB Wins First League Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Entering the day winless in conference, Sunday’s 2-0 victory over visiting Riverside proved to be exactly what the UCSB women’s soccer team needed to bounce back after a heartbreaking start to Big...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Entering the day winless in conference, Sunday’s 2-0 victory over visiting Riverside proved to be exactly what the UCSB women’s soccer team needed to bounce back after a heartbreaking start to Big West play.</p>\n<p>Junior midfielder Erin Ortega scored the go-ahead goal in the 50th minute to give the Gauchos their first conference win, improving the team’s record to 6-9-2 (1-4 Big West).</p>\n<p>“It’s what we needed,” Ortega said. “We needed to get one in, break them down.

Six minutes into the second half, Ortega put her open shot into the left corner of the net past the arms of Highlander freshman goalkeeper Sara Slaughter.</p>\n<p>“We practiced all week on going to goal,” Ortega said. “We were really focusing on going straight to goal.“</p>\n<p>Freshman forward/midfielder Indiana Meade closed out the match with an insurance goal in the 79th minute to put Santa Barbara ahead 2-0. After a deflection, Meade found herself in the right spot and sent the ball into the left of the net past the goalkeeper and another defender.</p>\n<p>“The first goal was great and getting the second goal just kind of let us settle down a little bit,” Meade said. “We were able to keep it and be secure in the back. And it’s always nice to go up two; or three — it could have been three.”</p>\n<p>Riverside, who defeated Cal Poly 2-1 in overtime on Thursday, came into the match with momentum, something UCSB seemed to lack. The Gauchos were shutout in their previous two games, both 1-0 losses last weekend.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been talking about scoring all year long,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Instead of us doing more of the chasing in the first half, I felt like once we got out of the first 15 minutes, they were doing more of the chasing. That wore them down and then the goals came.”</p>\n<p>Defensive play was once again strong for UCSB as sophomore goalkeeper Makenna Henry put forth a stellar effort with her fifth shutout of the season and first in conference play.

The Gauchos were only able to put away one of their 21 shot attempts throughout the game.</p>\n<p>The match served as a physical prequel to Saturday’s rematch. Five yellow cards in total were issued — two to UCSB and three to UCR. The Highlanders also lead the league in fouls called, averaging just over 15 whistle blows per game.</p>\n<p>“It’s just how we play,” junior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We want to make sure that they know we’re there.

UCSB is 6-1-1 at home, with its sole loss coming against Irvine in the second game of the season.</p>\n<p>UCR goalkeeper Cody Suppe leads the league in saves (59) and saves per game (4.54), and ranks at the bottom of the league in goals allowed.</p>\n<p>UCSB senior midfielder Luis Silva leads both the team and the conference in goals scored with nine total. Sophomore forward David Opoku trails Silva with seven goals on the season and junior forward Sam Garza has five.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense, which opened Big West play with a dismal three goals in the first three games, has scored nine goals in the three matches following. UCSB’s 6-0 thrashing of visiting Fullerton is the most goals scored by any team in Big West play this year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our guys stay after practice or before practice working on finishing,” Ryan said. “That’s one of our key goals. If we finish in the beginning [of games] we’ll be good.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42152\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-host-riverside-rematch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42152\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-host-riverside-rematch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-host-riverside-rematch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-host-riverside-rematch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-host-riverside-rematch/","id":1667,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1666,1665,1664],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hit the Road for Two-Game Weekend Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Posting their first conference victory in a 2-0 shutout against Riverside last week, the UCSB women’s soccer team will look to continue to build on that success when they travel north to take on Pac...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Untitled-23.jpg?resize=322%2C166\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Posting their first conference victory in a 2-0 shutout against Riverside last week, the UCSB women’s soccer team will look to continue to build on that success when they travel north to take on Pacific and Davis.</p>\n<p>With the victory, UCSB improved to 6-9-2 (1-4 Big West) on the season in a victory where they scored more than one goal for the first time since Sept. 9.</p>\n<p>“I do feel a sense of relief that we’re on the board, that we’ve got a win and we know we still can win,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “More than anything it’s a little bit of a relief and a little bit of confidence.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The Tigers are coming off a 3-2 loss in overtime to Davis last Thursday.</p>\n<p>Pacific’s offensive attack is headed by senior forward Kristina Wavomba, who is second in the Big West with eight goals on the season. Coming on strong of late is senior midfielder Alex Topp with six goals on the season, three coming in conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB will try to match its own offensive effort from the Riverside victory after freshman midfielder Indiana Mead and junior midfielder Erin Ortega each scored on Sunday. Also contributing was sophomore midfielder Erica Shelton with a team-high six shots, two on goal.</p>\n<p>“All the girls that play up top have it,” Mead said. “We can do it, it’s just we really have to work on finishing because we have the opportunities, obviously.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then travel to Davis on Sunday to face an Aggie team that has won three matches games in a row. Davis, 9-4-1 (3-1-1 Big West), has won their last three conference games after starting the season 0-1-1, with victories over Riverside, Pacific and Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“Anybody in the Big West will tell you going to play Pacific and Davis is difficult,” Stumpf said. “Davis is doing very well so it’s going to be a tough road trip for us.”</p>\n<p>Junior forward Allison Kelly leads the Aggies’ offense with six goals and a Big West high three coming in conference play. Davis leads all teams in conference play with 12 goals in only five games.</p>\n<p>“With all the talent across America in soccer, I always tell the team you’re not going to be able to stop the team from getting looks at the goal,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Makenna Henry will have the tough task of slowing down the Aggies’ offensive attack, but seems up to the challenge after holding the previous three opponents to a combined two goals.</p>\n<p>Kickoff at Pacific on Friday is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42140\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-hit-road-twogame-weekend-trip/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42140\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-hit-road-twogame-weekend-trip/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-hit-road-twogame-weekend-trip/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-hit-road-twogame-weekend-trip/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-21/gauchos-hit-road-twogame-weekend-trip/","id":1666,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1665,1664,1663],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
