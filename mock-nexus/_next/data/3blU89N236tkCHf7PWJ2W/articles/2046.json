He will serve alongside Weddle when she succeeds the current student regent, UC Los Angeles doctoral student Devon Graves, for this upcoming year; following Weddle’s term, Muwwakkil will take over and serve as the voting regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is comprised of</span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 26 appointed and ex-officio members </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that govern the UC system. The UC student regent is a full-voting regent of the University of California and the only voting member on the board who is required to be a student at one of the UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only real differences [between student regents and other appointed regents] is that they are closer to the student population, both in age and geographic proximity. The idea is that they might be able to leverage the student voice and kind of contextualize the policy decisions that are being made,” Muwwakkil said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will spend the first year of his two-year term learning the ropes of the position before transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first year, you’re participating in all of the committee meetings and going to all of the talks, but you’re not voting — you’re functionally shadowing the student regent who’s appointed in their second year of the position,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A record 113 UC students applied for the position of the 2020-21 student regent, </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-student-regent-nominated-2019-20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compared to 40 who applied in the cycle before</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Muwwakkil attributes this to the previous student regents’ efforts to publicize the position and inform students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Regent Graves and Regent Weddle made a point to visit all of the campuses and to market the position space… and encouraging a lot of folks who would not have applied otherwise to engage in the process,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a member of the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) at UCSB and a first-generation transfer student, Muwwakkil said he took notice of the lack of representation of students of color, and more specifically, nontraditional students of color, in student governance and higher education in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways Muwwakkill addressed this issue was by helping to revive UCSB’s BGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Myself and a lot of other graduate students of color found that our numbers are quite low. We decided to… revitalize the existing infrastructure of the Black Graduate Student Association of UCSB,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil worked with David Stamps, a doctoral student in the Department of Communications, to reestablish the BGSA, and eventually served as the second BGSA president during the 2017-18 academic year. During this time, he began to look for more avenues to expand his advocacy work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, he reasoned the best way to make an impact while fulfilling his academic commitments was by serving as student regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil initially applied for the position during the last application cycle but was passed over for Weddle. He will now be shadowing her as regent designate next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil said Weddle focuses on advocating for the “basic rights of students” like “food insecurity, housing security, accessibility” as well as on other issues like Title IX regulations and sexual violence on college campuses.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Weddle’s platform, Muwwakkil plans to bring attention to the challenges faced by nontraditional students.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we engage with leadership from each campus, we also have to be intentional to engage with students whose perspectives may very well not be represented by their leadership,” Muwwakkil said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Society does] this thing where we kind of focus in on like the 18-year-old, [and say] ‘Be stellar at 18 or no UC for you.’ I think this is a problem because there’s a lot of living that people do between the age of 18 and retirement. We need to validate the experiences of non-traditional students … within the classroom,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from Los Angeles City College, Muwwakkil said his experience has shaped his views about accessibility for nontraditional students navigating higher education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re [a] first-generation student going through college, there’s a lot of guesswork that happens … You’re confused about the process, what it means to apply,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As regent designate, Muwwakkil said he first hopes to educate himself on the operations and inner workings of the Board of Regents and maneuvering the system, as well as pressing issues within the system and how these relate to students and their success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m going to be doing a lot of fact finding and understanding what are the actual mechanisms by which things are done and accomplished; what are the prominent issues facing the UC and how the students build on their local campus level and the larger system,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his tenure as student regent, Muwwakkil said he hopes to further the UC system’s aim in cultivating an environment that is conducive to the success of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Are there ways that all of these different types of students can engage in the huge bureaucracy that is the university? If that’s true for some and not for others, then we have some work to do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

a payroll system meant to streamline the way payroll functions, was implemented on UCSB and other UC campuses throughout the course of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program’s website promises “Efficient, accurate payroll” — but since UC Path’s implementation, students across the UC have complained about delayed, missed or wrong pay, causing tension between the administration and students at the UC’s perceived inaction in fixing UCPath issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For most employers, not paying workers on time is a form of wage theft — but the University of California is currently exempt from the state’s strict wage theft laws,” a press release sent out by United Auto Workers Union (UAW) on Friday stated. UAW </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held a rally in March 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to protest the implementation of UCPath. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW President Kavitha Iyengar said in the press release that the union is “encouraged” and “looking forward” to seeing the bill move onto the Assembly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because there is no penalty for this, UC chose to use its own workers as an interest-free bank as they worked out the system’s glitches. Without accountability measures in place, we have no doubt that UC will continue to take advantage of workers who have no legal recourse,” Iyengar said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2019, the UC Office of the President </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took its first steps towards addressing the issue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of missed payments, offering varying amounts of money to approximately 750 workers who had been affected by UC Path. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 698, co-authored by Senator Connie Leyva and Senator Scott Wiener, takes a step beyond the offered compensation and would make it a requirement for the UC system to pay its workers on time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California law requires that employees be paid twice a month on designated “regular pay days”; workers classified as executive, administrative or professional employees can be paid once a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed through the California State Assembly and signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would require that university employees who are paid on a monthly basis be paid “no later than 5 days after the close of the monthly payroll period.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the bill would require the university to create payroll regulations for employees who are paid on a “more frequent basis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating current California payment law results in a misdemeanor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC doesn’t pay workers “on time and on a regular payday,” employees can file a claim in state court or with the Labor Commissioner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC Path serves UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UCOP and UCSB.

Each bench had a photo of the victim as well as a short paragraph about them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crowd entered Anisq’oyo Park, Kira Weiss, Ph.D. ethnomusicology student at UCSB, played several songs on the cello to welcome them in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once everyone was settled in, Weiss played a theme composed by Heena Yoon, Ph.D. candidate in music, three times in a row, and asked the audience to hum along. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The theme, called “Hope in the Labyrinth,” has been played every year since 2014, Weiss said, but this is the first time she has been able to play it at the annual vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The indication for how to play [the theme] is slowly, in grief, but then it’s also supposed to be hopeful too and I think [Yoon’s] idea with everybody humming together is like trying to find connection and find the strength of our voices together,” Weiss said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer and Collins Puente spoke once again after the cello music and thanked the audience for attending before introducing the first speaker of the evening, Chancellor Henry T. Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a heartfelt turnout from our students, our staff and our colleagues, professors and our community members,” Yang began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are all coming together as a community to honor and remember one of the campus’s most difficult moments. Five years ago, our university faced an unthinkable tragedy. We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang went on to name each of the victims and talked about the hopes, dreams and ambitions they carried. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each of these six students were shining stars, beaming with the same brilliance and warmth like the candles among us,” Yang said.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We suffered the tragic loss of six of our own and saw pain inflicted on nine injured. When one hurts, we all hurt.” </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next speaker, UCPD Officer Ariel Bournes, touched upon his own experience as a first responder that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes, who studied art at UCSB, worked as a community service officer (CSO) when he attended UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes later worked on community outreach for the UCSB police department for several years. But at the end of the day, he found that many of the conversations he had with students and community members ended with them expressing frustration that other police officers didn’t feel the same way as he did. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of the conversations ended something like this: ‘Hey Ariel, that was awesome that you came out, and you listened, and you conversed with us. But here’s the thing: you’re not even a police officer!’” Bournes said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After I heard that speech one too many times, I decided, ‘I’m gonna become a police officer.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a goofy kid who “regularly walked around with paint splattered on [his] clothing from various art projects [he] was working on,” Bournes said even his own mother didn’t think he could become a police officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he faced the same sentiment from several other police officers in the department, there was one officer who Bournes said gave him a chance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of them said, ‘Okay, you should come on a ride-along with me.’ So we looked at our schedules, we worked it out and we circled the date.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes paused for a long time, as audience members began to put the story together in their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he finally spoke again, his voice cracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“May 23, 2014.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Less than 30 minutes into my first police ride-along, the shooting started. I got a front row seat to things that no one should ever have to see. And here I stand, five years later, now an officer myself, thinking back to that moment, and thinking back to the hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of moments that we all shared as a community in the aftermath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the one thing Bournes wanted attendees to remember was how the community responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used art and protest and therapy and faith and food and tears and research and collaboration and passion and planning in order to heal and to protect and to overcome. It was exemplary. It was astonishing. And it was, and it is, an honor and a privilege to be counted as even a small piece of this community. Isla Vista, you are the template. You are a gift and we love you.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-88670-2-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC04923.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88673\",\"title\":\"DSC04923\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC04988.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88681\",\"title\":\"DSC04988\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC05128.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88692\",\"title\":\"DSC05128\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC05045.jpg?fit=1874%2C2048\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88685\",\"title\":\"DSC05045\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC05058.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88686\",\"title\":\"DSC05058\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/DSC04975.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88679\",\"title\":\"DSC04975\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Max Abrams \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bournes’ remarks were followed by a reading of the names of the victims, a moment of silence and a song of remembrance by Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, spoke afterward. Klawunn, who arrived on campus in Fall Quarter 2015, spoke about how even though she wasn’t here when the community suffered the tragedy, she was able to see how it came together in the months and years afterward to become stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have learned so much about [the victims’] legacies through the values of community here,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I love the features of our everyday lives that arise from the love and strength that members of this community found in themselves in 2014, like the cranes in the Student Resource Building, the lights in the tunnel that we walked through tonight and in the Love and Remembrance Garden,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parents of Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Katie Cooper and George Chen all spoke at the memorial event as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Martinez, Christopher Michaels-Martinez’s father, read a poem by Courtney Martin titled “A Responsibility to Light.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The poem urged listeners to feel their emotions strongly, even the difficult ones, and to use those feelings to drive them to create art of any kind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Cooper, Katie Cooper’s father, talked about how much his daughter loved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She had offers at three other universities, and came here on an open event; it was kind of an open house, with one of her girl friends. And in about ten minutes she was like ‘This is where I needed to be,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She just loved it, and really felt at home here, and I think that’s a tribute to everybody who’s here today, and what you’ve brought to the community and what you’ve brought to the university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly Wang, George Chen’s mother, thanked the audience, and the two fathers, for helping her feel like she isn’t going through this alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As you all see, it’s not easy, and it’s even heartbreaking, for me to be here, because I know at the end of this trip, coming all the way from San Jose, I won’t be able to see the beautiful face of my son George,” Wang said. “However, I choose to stand here, bravely, because I want to share some of the words from my heart with you.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“First, I want to say, with a mother’s heart, I care about you, and I think every student of UCSB, or every college student, is my child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang urged audience members to always be kind, even in little ways, to the people around them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Wang, several long-time community members – Associated Students Executive Director Marisela Marquez, Ph.D. candidate Melissa Barthelemy, I.V. Community Services District General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Educational Opportunity Program Director Aaron Jones – all spoke about how moved they were by the way I.V. came together in the days after the shooting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the memorial came to an end, Collins Puente tearfully thanked the audience for attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And thank you to everyone that continues to create and hold space for our beloved community.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez Rivera contributed reporting.</span></i></p>\n<p>Further photos of all of the memorial events held between May 18 and May 23 can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/in-photos-five-years-since-may-23-2014/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

year.<em> </em></span><em>Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plaintiff in the most recent case, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Lee Reyes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> v. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of California Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is UC Santa Barbara UC Police Department officer Jonathan Lee Reyes. In the suit, Reyes alleges he was retaliated against for reporting misconduct in the department relating to the retention and promotion of an unqualified police trainee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that Reyes’ whistleblowing led UCPD Lieutenant David Millard and UCPD Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky to block Reyes from receiving a promotion to higher positions and that the two gave Reyes an unfair poor performance review.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an individual within UCPD who asked that their name not be used, Millard is currently at a training course at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy; the individual provided photographic evidence to the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Millard was there and not on the UC Santa Barbara campus as of May 9. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was unable to comment on whether or not Millard was at the FBI academy, but could confirm that he is still an active member of the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that UCPD “retaliated against other employees based on the same protected class [as Reyes].” The suit also alleges that UCPD failed to  “discipline other employees outside [Reyes’] own protected class as severely” for the same actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes’ lawsuit is the latest of four lawsuits filed against the department since late last year, all of which allege that the plaintiffs were retaliated against for blowing the whistle on misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other three suits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v.

UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the complaint alleges that Millard repeatedly promoted a trainee officer from lower positions despite opposition from Reyes and others in the department who were concerned about the trainee’s performance. Reyes alleges he brought concerns forward to Millard multiple times, including when the trainee was first assigned to Reyes and later when Millard announced the trainee had completed Field Training Officer (FTO) training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case alleges that Millard’s approval to promote the unqualified trainee created “a threat to the safety of the public and the University” and violated <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=832\">California Penal Code 832</a>, which states that “a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">peace officer shall satisfactorily complete an introductory training course.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in court documents begin in June 2017, when Reyes was assigned as an FTO with the trainee. Court documents say that after Millard announced in an email that the trainee will advance to the next phase, Reyes, along with several other officers, objected the promotion, pointing to “multiple evaluations by FTO’s [which] indicated that the trainee was failing,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite an FTO’s recommendation for the trainee’s termination and the trainee’s failure to pass a program from the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (P.O.S.T.) — the body responsible for creating law enforcement training requirements — Lieutenant Millard “successfully released [the trainee] from FTO training,” court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes then allegedly emailed the region coordinator for P.O.S.T. to relay his concerns about the failing trainee. Millard later met with Reyes and accused him of “not following an order” to promote the trainee, court documents allege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, Reyes was denied a promotion to corporal, despite being “better qualified for the position than other candidates selected for the position,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in September 2017, Reyes applied for a position as a sergeant but was again denied the promotion in March 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes alleges that he did not receive these positions, despite his qualifications, due to retaliation from Millard regarding the trainee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit also alleges that Reyes’ poor performance review from 2018 was another result of the department’s retaliation, this time from Smorodinsky “under the direction of [Millard].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents state “the review was very critical” and omitted “various positive things throughout the year.” Reyes submitted a grievance to the department “which detailed each point in his review that he felt was inaccurate or unwarranted,” and his review was later overturned in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations in the suit involve a handful of other officers as well, including former Police Chief Dustin Olson, former Assistant Chief Cathy Farley, Sergeant Gregory Pierce and Sergeant Rory Sheehey, who are named in the other cases as well. However, none of the aforementioned officers are being sued in Reyes’ case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three of the four cases filed since November 2018, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes v. UC Regents</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are represented by the same law firm, Richie Litigation, based in Los Angeles. Antonio Castillo, a lawyer handling the cases from Richie Litigation, said in an email that the three cases “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are exposing long-term systemic systems of bullying and the suppression of the advancement of minority police officers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan Smith, the plaintiff in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Doe v. UC Regents, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the only officer of the five who worked with a different attorney, Peter Horton, to file his claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits brought forward by Reyes, Signa and the Littles are steps toward addressing the department’s alleged misconduct, according to Castillo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That these brave officers have come forward and inspired many more to do so means that we finally have an opportunity to make real progress in changing how the UCSB Police Department operates,” Castillo said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
