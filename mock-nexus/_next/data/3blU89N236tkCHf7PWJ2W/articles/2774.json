Najera will focus her discussion on how undocumented students are engaging in activism in the public education system.</p>\n<p>Najera said students should be aware of minority groups on and around campus.</p>\n<p>“If we want to be informed and engaged in our society, we cannot ignore our neighbors and what they might be going through,” Najera said. “It is important for UCSB students to know who is in their community, what issues, politics these people are facing and the situation they are in to help us make better choices.”</p>\n<p>MCC publicist and marketing coordinator Carol Dinh said Najera’s talk aims to create a safe atmosphere for students to discuss undocumented students’ challenges.</p>\n<p>“This lecture in particular will help bring more attention to the status of undocumented students at our university, with the aim of creating a safe space where students can ask questions and learn how to be proactive to defend the right to education for all young people,” Dinh said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we want to be informed and engaged in our society, we cannot ignore our neighbors and what they might be going through. – UC Riverside Professor Jennifer Najera</p></blockquote>\n<p>Only five to 10 percent of undocumented students graduating high school have the opportunity to attend a university, and even fewer receive financial aid, according to Dinh.</p>\n<p>“[These students] are an integral part of our campus … and are a marginalized group that are ‘unseen,’ as their status is often times kept private,” Dinh said.</p>\n<p>Najera said undocumented students are diligent in educating themselves and others about their cause.</p>\n<p>“What I have seen in my research is that they are actively creating learning experiences outside their classrooms,” Najera said. “They are involved on an everyday level and on education projects, whether it be educating themselves about immigration policies or ways they could be participating in the community to educating other people.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Isabel Czarnecki said undocumented students have the same right to education as their native-born peers.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great cause because even if you aren’t documented, everyone deserves a right to an education,” Czarnecki said. “I don’t think their citizenship should declare the education they can or cannot get.”</p>\n<p>Dinh said the MCC hopes students who attend the talk will leave with a different perspective on undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“We hope that by exposing students to the adversities faced by undocumented students that they can slowly begin to shift and shape their world view and language,” Dinh said.</p>\n<p>According to Dinh, the MCC created the Race Matters series to educate students on the challenges their classmates may be facing.</p>\n<p>“Race Matters is a series of interactive discussions that probe or explore issues related to race on a deeper level and examines its continued impact on marginalized communities within larger societal structures,” Dinh said. “The MCC hopes to broaden awareness and contribute to an ongoing dialogue and reflection on important issues.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

platforms during a forum on Monday. <em>Lianna Nakashima/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With campaigning for Associated Students elections underway, candidates for A.S. Senate extended their platforms Monday at The Hub, pointing to their own experiences and calling for unity between the oft-divided campus parties.</p>\n<p>Students can vote for A.S. elected officials starting April 23. Official slates for the 2018-19 A.S. Senate can be found here.</p>\n<p>For the most part, candidates for both Campus United (CU) and the Isla Vista Party (IVP) converged on issues at the official forum, agreeing on topics like safety in I.V., keeping tuition and student fees at a minimum and voting for Measure R, which would fund the I.V. Community Services District.</p>\n<p>There were few points of tension, but the candidates did take different approaches when it came to discussing a fee initiative that would fund a controversial University Center renovation. While IVP candidates criticized the project’s proposed use of student fees, CU’s batch of A.S. hopefuls said students themselves should be the main deciders of whether the plan is best for them.</p>\n<p>Monday’s questions, written by both A.S. Elections Board and submitted anonymously by audience members during the forum, included topics about I.V. safety, the proposed NewCen project, I.V. governance and other off-campus issues.</p>\n<p>Candidates’ responses to these questions and overarching goals are summarized below:</p>\n<p>Ashley Ng, an IVP candidate, said equipping Community Service Officers with official school vehicles would be a good way to ensure safety for I.V. residents. To CU candidate Sydney Karmes-Wainer, an off-campus CU candidate, the most important changes needed are the most visible and tangible ones, which she said take shape in facilities that need better upkeep.</p>\n<p>CU’s Amy Zhou said redrawing inefficient parking lines would be first on her agenda, while her partymate Mordi Shadpour said his main goal was making the area “very safe for everyone and welcoming to students from all walks of life.” He cited his work with UC Santa Barbara Life of the Party in promoting safer alcohol and drug use in I.V.</p>\n<p>Salvadore Hernandez Arellano of IVP noted that ramping up the use of blue lighting and decreasing police presence in I.V. would help make the community safer.</p>\n<p>CU’s Adam Chohan didn’t mention a specific action, but rather said his first line of action would be to talk to the people he’d be working to represent.</p>\n<p>Jasmine Palmerin of IVP said her main focus is to create a safer I.V. by lighting up dimmer areas and installing emergency blue lights throughout I.V. that have call buttons to contact local law enforcement. With her experience as a volunteer for the Women’s Center, she believes sexual assault hasn’t been acknowledged in I.V. and is something she will focus on as senator.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Christian Ornelas said he wants to work toward addressing the mold problem in I.V. housing. He said he will work toward getting units better ventilation by talking to landlords and opening up tenant-to-landlord communication. Ornelas supports Measure R, which would fund the CSD, in order to address tenant and landlord mediation.</p>\n<p>Dallin Mello of IVP said he will create a commission that bridges connections for student workers and the City of Santa Barbara. Mello said student workers have different needs than most students, and he hopes to build opportunities for them. In response to a question about differences in political beliefs, Mello said, “just because we don’t see eye to eye, doesn’t mean we can’t work together.”</p>\n<p>CU’s Nicole Estess hopes to work with the CSD and I.V. Foot Patrol to integrate more lighting in I.V. and work as a mediator with local law enforcement. Estess currently works in with the EVPSA office lobbying for UC funding.</p>\n<p>Alexander “Alex” Young of CU, said he will focus on I.V. and UCSB sustainability as well as opening up communication with his constituents. He said he is also in support of Measure R to fund the CSD. In response to his support for the NewCen project, Young said, “it’s up to the student themselves if their fees should be used for the UCen.”</p>\n<p>CU’s Andrew Nguyen said that creating online forums for A.S. committees will build communication between A.S. and the student body. In response to the question about the NewCen project, Nguyen said he sees that “it might be a long-term investment.”</p>\n<p>Yara Khamis of CU will strive to open up more means of communication to build “a stronger community,” especially between permanent residents of I.V. and students. She wants to improve the way sexual assault is addressed in I.V. and is a supporter of Measure R.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Ryan Clark said he wants to make Gaucho Care more inclusive and help improve the quality of parks in I.V. Clark wants to work toward making sure that sexual assault cases reach the appropriate authorities and have more students involved in community based policing.</p>\n<p>Jalia “Jolly” Carlton-Carew of IVP said she will strive to create a web-series show about Isla Vista “to craft our own narrative to tell our own story.” She believes the NewCen should not come from student fees, but that the university should allocate that funding and “we shouldn’t have to pay for things that we should already be provided.”</p>\n<p>Carla Cernat of CU wants to create more community based policing and implement restorative justice-based programs for students. She hopes to extend C.A.R.E. workshops and sexual assault training to all students, not just fraternities and sororities. Cernat also wants to increase safety in I.V. and believes she has done so already in helping create the Sun Fest, an alternative Deltopia activity for students.</p>\n<p>CU’s Zachary Zeising, sustainability chair of his fraternity, said he wants to push for safety and environmentally friendly systems in I.V. He specifically wants to install an emergency blue light system in I.V. to help create faster responses to sexual assault incidents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Center Lounge Thursday evening titled “Challenging the Borders of Education: Undocumented Students and Public Pedagogy” to discuss how undocumented immigrants maneuver public education.</p>\n<p>During her talk, Nájera recounted her experiences meeting with undocumented students and the struggles that their community faces in education and immigration reform. Nájera’s past encounters with undocumented immigrants inspired her to do anthropological research for Providing Opportunities, Dreams, and Education in Riverside (PODER), an organization dedicated to serving undocumented students at UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>According to Nájera, people need to be taught to view undocumented students as people rather than as a certain stereotype or a number in order to understand issues associated with immigration.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the public pedagogy comes in,” Nájera said, “taking advantage of ways that people can educate others outside the classroom about who community members are, what they contribute, what their dreams and aspirations are.”</p>\n<p>Nájera said she hopes to increase general understanding of the undocumented community through her research.</p>\n<p>“I hope that it broadens peoples’ understanding of the way activism occurs: not always in big demonstrations but in small ways – micro politics,” Nájera said. “And also I hope that it stretches the way we perceive education and where it can occur, not just in classrooms, but outside how people are creating spaces of learning.”</p>\n<p>According to Nájera, she wants to work with members of PODER to help adapt UCR facilities to adequately serve undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“Last year they [PODER] were able to lobby the office of student affairs to create an undocumented students task force representative from all of the major staffing entities: housing, financial aid, counseling, career services,” Nájera said. “They wanted to make sure that in each of these areas where students were going to be present that they had some kind of training about undocumented students.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology and Asian American studies double major Madison Villanueva said she is an undocumented student, and identified with Nájera’s talk. Villanueva said the lack of medical options is one obstacle undocumented immigrants face in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“I do feel that there are more uncertainties that face us who are undocumented after graduating,” Villanueva said in an email. “Currently, there isn’t anything statewide that guarantees some sort of healthcare for all undocumented immigrants.”</p>\n<p>Despite the hardships undocumented students face in the U.S., returning to their countries of origin may mean worse conditions, according to Villanueva.</p>\n<p>“Many undocumented folks also come from countries that are practically in shambles from violence and destroyed economies and returning to these countries are not options,” Villanueva said in an email.</p>\n<p>Villanueva said, as a member of the undocumented community, she experiences more than just the pressures of being a student.</p>\n<p>“The uncertainty of my parents’ future because we are undocumented adds to the stress of being a college student,” Villanueva said in an email. “On top of that, I need to support my family financially while supporting myself at school while trying to not get caught up in anything in the over-policed Isla Vista (because anything police related as an undocumented immigrant is closely related to the threat of deportation.)”</p>\n<p>According to Villanueva, she is glad to have found support at UCSB to help overcome her obstacles.</p>\n<p>“Being undocumented definitely exacerbates pressure and stresses of being a college student, and if it wasn’t for a small supportive community I found in UCSB, I honestly don’t know how I could thrive or even survive,” Villanueva said in an email.</p>\n<p>MCC Acting Programmer Kelsey Thibdeau said she believes Nájera’s research is crucial for helping people understand how the undocumented students “fit into our larger societal structure.”</p>\n<p>“The mission for the MCC is to be a safe space where we can explore some of these difficult issues of race, sexuality, issues that don’t necessarily get brought up in other spaces here,” Thibdeau said. “We like to believe that we are promoting different types of programming and events that reach out to underrepresented populations on our community campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Further investigation revealed numerous infection control breeches at Thomashefsky’s office, resulting in its closure in March. As of April 26, six of Thomashefsky’s patients have tested positive for Hepatitis C out of 240 patients, five of which are believed to be new cases.</p>\n<p>According to a PHD press release, four of the six patients who tested positive for Hepatitis C received injections from Thomashefsky’s office on the same day.</p>\n<p>“The new findings released today bring new urgency to the Health Department’s recommendation that any patients of Dr. Thomashefsky get tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV,” the press release states. “People infected with hepatitis C often have no symptoms. Testing is the only way to know if a person is infected.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Often times they occur because individuals may not possess adequate knowledge on infection control practices, or sometimes because standards and modes of practice shift. Adhering to infection control practices, including injection safety, is key to safe patient care and protecting employees from infectious diseases. – PHD Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director Paige Batson</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, PHD Deputy Director Susan Klein-Rothschild said PHD cannot be certain if the newly infected patients were exposed to Hepatitis C in Thomashefsky’s office until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) completes molecular genetic testing.</p>\n<p>“We do not yet have scientific confirmation that those who have newly diagnosed Hepatitis C acquired this virus from his [Dr. Thomashefsky’s] office,” Klein-Rothschild said in an email. “We await the results of molecular genetic testing from the CDC.”</p>\n<p>Director of Student Health Dr. Mary Ferris said blood-borne viruses like Hepatitis C do not spread easily.</p>\n<p>“These diseases … they usually require a significant blood exposure such as a deep needle puncture, not just a drop of blood on intact skin,” Farris said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director at PHD Paige Batson, infection control breaches like those found at Thomashefsky’s medical clinic happen because medical professionals are not educated in safe practices.</p>\n<p>“Often times they occur because individuals may not possess adequate knowledge on infection control practices, or sometimes because standards and modes of practice shift,” Batson said in an email. “Adhering to infection control practices, including injection safety, is key to safe patient care and protecting employees from infectious diseases.”</p>\n<p>Ferris said information explaining proper disease and infection prevention procedures is readily available to medical offices.</p>\n<p>“An entire body of scientific knowledge is available to guide us in how to minimize the risk of spreading infections through both cleaning and prevention,” Ferris said in an email. “Health professionals specialize in setting up these programs and monitoring their success.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Infection control breaches can occur at any time in a clinical practice. It is sometimes the little things that can place patients at risk from infection control breaches. – PHD Disease Control &amp; Prevention Programs Director Paige Batson</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Batson, even seemingly minor mistakes — like lapses in hand washing — in a medical office can cause infection control breaches.</p>\n<p>“Infection control breaches can occur at any time in a clinical practice,” Batson said in an email. “It is sometimes the little things that can place patients at risk from infection control breaches.”</p>\n<p>First-year electrical engineering major Millan Batra said the story of Dr. Thomashefsky’s medical office makes him wary of medical offices.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s bullshit that they would let an infectious disease run rampant like that,” Batra said. “It means there were procedural problems.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62956\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/patients-test-positive-for-hepatitis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62956\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/patients-test-positive-for-hepatitis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/patients-test-positive-for-hepatitis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/patients-test-positive-for-hepatitis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/patients-test-positive-for-hepatitis/","id":2771,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2770,2769,2768],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
