In addition to leading the conference in goals (15), total points (31) and shots (80), DePuy was best in the clutch as he led both the nation and conference with eight game-winning goals and is currently third all-time in Big West history with 14 career game-winners. The Gauchos’ sharpshooter also tied for third in the nation in scoring with 15 goals. Becoming the first player in Big West history to earn three straight Big West Offensive Player of the Week awards this season, DePuy’s impact on the field is inevitable as Santa Barbara is 16-0-4 all-time when the forward scores a goal.

The goal was the German’s sixth of the year, a team-high and tied for the 15th highest individual tally in the nation, to go with two assists.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the defensive woes from the previous four matches continued, as four minutes later freshman goalkeeper Titouan Le Roux punched out a cross to a wide open Jose Carerra-Garcia just beyond the penalty spot, who smashed in the second chance to equalize for the Bears.</p>\n<p>Again, like in the last couple losses, UCSB remained the team driving forward and pressing on for a goal, and their efforts were rewarded in the 78th minute from their umpteenth cross of the game. Substitute winger Dalton Pando found space on the left and lobbed it up to the far post, where the 6’5” striker Nick DePuy rose above the defenders to head in his fourth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>Yet another defensive lapse would cost the Gauchos’ their lead, though, when Le Roux’s short pass to a defender went behind its target and Cal intercepted, firing a quick pass through a hole in the middle and midfielder Nick Lima finished it off to equalize at two apiece. This was the third match in a row that the Gauchos allowed a game-tying or game-winning goal in the last five minutes of regulation, and their inability to close out the win cost them again in overtime.</p>\n<p>In extra time, Cal had far more energy, UCSB likely drained from conceding another crucial goal at the end of the first ninety minutes. The Golden Bears found plenty of space down the wing, then sent a ball across the six-yard box to Christian Thierjung, who tapped in the cutback pass with a tidy one-time finish.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was outshot 21-16, but kept the Bears under wraps for the first sixty minutes thanks to nine saves from Le Roux. Despite a career-high number of stops from the Frenchman, the Gauchos gave up three goals for the second straight match and for the third time during the losing streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s slide comes at a suboptimal time, with the Big West Conference season beginning Thursday with a trip to UC Riverside, but UCSB will be confident going into the league opener knowing they were able to finish last year 7-2-1, including a 2-0 home win versus the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>The Riverside match will be played Thursday at the UCR Soccer Stadium at 7 p.m. An audio stream will be available on the schedule page of the men’s soccer <a href=\"http://ucsbgauchos.com\">UCSBgauchos.com</a> website and the game.

Unfortunately for the Gauchos, though, the ball was just out of All-American striker Nick DePuy’s reach right before the break, leaving LMU’s lead at 1-0 going into the locker room.</p>\n<p>Less than two minutes into the second half, LMU doubled their lead with a wonder of a volley from 25 yards by Jose Ochoa. The ball bounced out in front of him perfectly, and the Lions’ defender struck an inch-perfect screamer that flew past the helpless Le Roux in the right side netting.</p>\n<p>“The biggest issue for us is that we have two or three players that would absolutely help us and would’ve gotten us out of a game like this, but this was a tired group tonight after UCLA,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Feucht won the ball on the wing and feinted to his right before finding DePuy, who was taken down by a rash Lion challenge. Feucht then stepped up to slot the penalty into the bottom right corner past the diving keeper for his team-leading fifth goal.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ second goal came 10 minutes later when Josue España’s curling shot from the top of the box troubled the goalkeeper. The shot was blocked, but it landed just in the middle of the box, where an oncoming Noah Billingsley slotted past the grounded keeper to equalize at 2-2.</p>\n<p>Billingsley, who was capped with the New Zealand U-20s team at the 2015 U-20 World Cup, found the net for the first time in UCSB colors and toyed with the LMU left-back all night in what was probably the best performance of his debut season thus far.</p>\n<p>LMU regained their lead in the 83rd minute, though, when midfielder Antonio Porreco carved his way with a swerved dribbling run, finishing off the move with a tidy left-footed shot across the goal.</p>\n<p>Just a minute later, the Lions failed to clear out a corner fully, and the second cross found Feucht on the far side, who chested down the cross and tapped a light volley into DePuy. The striker controlled the ball with his first touch, and his second was a rifled left-footed shot that rose into the top-right corner to draw the Gauchos level for the second time, this time at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The game took its final turn in the 86th minute when an LMU corner was sent dangerously into a huge crowd of players from each team, and Connor Johnson rose highest to head home past Le Roux who was knocked down in the mix-up. The last 10 minutes were wide open, but Johnson’s header gave the visitors their third win against Big West opposition.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next match is their final non-conference game of the regular season against Cal at 7:05 p.m. on Friday, September 23 at Harder Stadium</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/no-25-gauchos-drop-fourth-straight-match/","id":1432,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1431,1430,1429],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to No. 25, Hope to End Losing Slump vs LMU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_008-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MSoccer_USC_11.22.15_Eric_Swenson_008-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Preparing for its second match of a three-game home stand, the No. 25 UCSB men's soccer team looks to redeem itself of its recent three match losing streak as it will host LMU at Harder Stadium.

Moreover, the Lions have achieved success when facing Big West competition, defeating UC Davis 2-0 and UC Irvine 1-0 just days after losing a close meeting with Sac State 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will hope to avenge their most recent loss, looking to reclaim their home field after conceding a last-second free kick against No. 6 UCLA that forced overtime at a 1-1 tie before the Bruins found their eventual winner in the added period.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB’s pursuit to reclaim its home field is junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who scored his team-high fourth goal of the season against UCLA and has been the driving force of the Gauchos’ attack thus far.</p>\n<p>Behind Feucht, freshman Daniel Amo, senior Nick DePuy and junior Ahinga Selemani each have two goals and an assist to their names, while senior midfielder Josue España leads the team with three assists.</p>\n<p>However, though UCSB has succeeded offensively thus far this season (tied for the conference high in total team goals with 12), LMU’s defense will pose one of the sternest challenges yet, possessing a goals against average of .88 per game.</p>\n<p>Collectively, Santa Barbara has looked strong going forward with their marauding runs from the midfield and direct wing play, but have been lacking goals during their recent slump, differing from their early-season scoring form. The Gauchos have scored a single goal or less in their last two matches (Akron and UCLA) after scoring two or more goals in three of their previous five games.</p>\n<p>The UCSB defense, however, looked much improved against UCLA after struggling to avoid crucial mistakes throughout the Akron Tournament. In Ohio, the Gauchos gave up six goals in two matches, but kept one of the nation’s best teams, UCLA, under wraps for the most part, and were unlucky to lose their clean sheet to the controversial free kick equalizer.</p>\n<p>Amo, who usually plays in the midfield, was moved to center-back to replace usual starter Sam Strong, who received a red card in the team’s match against the Bruins. The Ghanaian defender was a rock in the back, sliding to stop a couple clear chances to go with a few vital clearances. With Strong back in the rotation, however, Amo will be wondering if he’s done enough to retain his new position on the team after a comprehensive display in his first defensive start.</p>\n<p>Regardless, UCSB showed signs of improvement from their recent funk against UCLA and will have high hopes of getting a positive result at home versus the Lions.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host LMU Wednesday at 7:05 p.m. at Harder Stadium.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Although the Gauchos are coming off their first loss of the season, they maintain their dominance, especially on the defensive end. The team’s defense has been dominant so far this season, allowing only four goals this year.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Brittney Rogers had not been scored upon all year until the Texas – San Antonio game last Friday, and Santa Barbara’s streak of six straight shutouts tied the school record set in 1989.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s outstanding defensive line is led by senior Sydney Fuertes and junior Kate Shoemaker who have each started all nine games for the Gauchos. Also providing strong contributions are sophomore Ryan Kokoska and senior Savannah Francis.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also feature a strong offensive attack. They have scored 19 goals this year, averaging over two goals per game. Junior forward Amanda Ball leads the team and ranks second in the Big West with eight goals in the year. She also leads the team with 33 shots and 19 shots on goal to go along with a 57.6 percent shot on goal percentage.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward/midfielder Shaelan Murison has also emerged for the Gauchos, coming off a spectacular hat trick performance against Texas – San Antonio last week. She now has four goals on the season, all coming in the last three games.</p>\n<p>In addition, sophomore Mallory Hromatko has three goals this year and has taken 14 shots — six on goal — providing solid contributions along the front line.</p>\n<p>The team also has 17 assists on the year. Three players each lead the team in assists this year with three apiece: senior midfielder Ashley Dean, sophomore midfielder Madeline Gibson and senior defender Savannah Francis.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the Gauchos, the University of the Pacific has not fared well so far this season.</p>\n<p>After being defeated 2-1 by UC Davis last week, the Tigers have scored only five goals in their seven games played this year and have tallied two assists thus far while possessing a subpar .077 shot percentage.</p>\n<p>Pacific is currently led by its freshman midfielder Sigrid Aas who has two goals this season. She has taken 14 shots with eight of those on goal.</p>\n<p>Junior defender Loren Landrus also has two goals for the Tigers this year with four shots on goal. The only other player to score a goal for the team is junior midfielder Lily Higashino.</p>\n<p>Pacific is fresh off a five-game road trip and will be playing at home at Knoles Field for the first time since late August. The Gauchos, who will be playing the third of a four-game road trip, can expect the Tigers to be excited for their return home in pursuit of an upset.</p>\n<p>Unlike Pacific, LMU has gotten off to a more positive start as it was able to put together a three-game winning streak earlier in the month with wins over CSU Bakersfield, Long Beach State and Ball State. The Lions most recent game, however, against Texas Tech was a tough battle that ended in a double overtime tie.</p>\n<p>So far, the Lions have scored a total of 20 goals in addition to recording 13 assists. Sophomore forward Sarina Bolden leads the team with three goals this season and has established a strong presence on offense.
