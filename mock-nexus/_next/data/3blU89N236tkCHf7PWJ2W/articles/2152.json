The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would receive support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Services District finalized an agreement during its Jan. 8 meeting to open a survivor resource center in Isla Vista in collaboration with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault, a organization addressing sexual assault in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) President Emily Montalvo-Telford said the new center would make it easier for survivors to meet with a Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) representative and receive immediate counseling. The center will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p>The center will provide a place in I.V. where survivors can receive medical attention, make a police report and obtain an emergency protective order. Previously, survivors would only have access to these services at STESA’s location in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Survivors will also be able to obtain emergency services such as food, shelter and transportation. The center will also have the resources to help survivors apply for U Visas and T Visas, Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>U visas are non-immigrant visas designed to aid victims of crime who have suffered physical or mental abuse in the U.S. and are assisting the investigation of the crime. T visas provide the same service to those who have suffered from human trafficking.</p>\n<p>The idea for a Survivor Resource Center in I.V. began with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">Ro’Shawndra Earvin’s 2017 Demands</a>, a list of 12 demands presented to Chancellor Yang after a 13 hour sit-in.</p>\n<p>Earvin, a former student at UCSB and advocate for sexual assault reforms, along with a large group of students, presented a list of 12 demands calling for sexual assault reform. The No. 1 demand on the list called for the creation of a survivor resource center.</p>\n<p>STESA, along with SASA and the I.V. CSD board members, have been collaborating over the past year in order to make the center a reality.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said work on the project first began in Spring 2018 when he was approached by Montalvo and Madeline Loudon, I.V. Community Coordinator for SASA. They presented to Brandt the lack of services for survivors of sexual assault provided by UCSB and said that the resource center would be a quick solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>“We want to be a voice for survivors when there are injustices in the system,” Brandt said. “So this, in particular, is an example of a supporting service.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the center primarily comes from the Measure R tax that was passed last year, granting the CSD a source of revenue for their projects.</p>\n<p>The survivor resource center will be located in a central location in I.V. and will be easily accessible for residents of the community, Montalvo said. To access the center, a survivor would need to call STESA’s hotline at (805) 564-3696, where they will be directed by an advocate to the center for aid.</p>\n<p>“During our budgeting process this year, it was a big priority for the budget committee to make a line item specifically for renovating this space so that it could become the survivor resource center,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Montalvo and Brandt both mentioned how rewarding it was to work with the various groups dedicated to resolving the issue of sexual assault in I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, this project was one of the smoothest that I’ve ever seen, especially when it comes to projects where I’ve worked with student groups on it, and that is really a testament to SASA and everything they’ve done. The same would go for STESA,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Arturo Martinez is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

As everyone is in the midst of midterms these days, I thought I’d get on the train and give out some grades myself, because giving out grades is much better than receiving them. Here’s a look at how my teachers and I are doing according to the rigorous standards I maintain:</p>\n<p><strong>Charlotte Scatliffe </strong><em>(Beginning Tennis)</em></p>\n<p>Charlotte, as we call her, is the best of the bunch. Having been a student as recently as a few years ago, she knows college students are the most A.D.D. of any demographic in the world and she deals with them better than any other ESS teacher I’ve had. Class is usually divided into four activities, and you rotate with your group to each of them throughout the 50-minute period. There’s everything from competitive games to practicing ground strokes with the ball machine. Always active, always having fun. Scatliffe has all kinds of funny stories about her tennis-nazi father to keep us entertained, and when she instructs us on how to do something, she’s patient and thorough. Plus, she wins bonus points for knowing my name.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Kathy Gregory<em> </em></strong><em>(Beginning Volleyball)</em></p>\n<p>Kathy embodies “Legend of the Dome” in every way possible. I wake up Mondays and Wednesdays knowing I’m about to sweat more than in any other class because at least half of every period is dedicated to running, lunging and jumping drills. Honestly, I think I’ve upped my vertical from about six inches to at least eight. Naturally, I would rather be playing volleyball the whole time because I’m tall and it’s fun to spike it in people’s faces like in Meet the Parents, but I appreciate the exercise it gives me. When we are not doing the drills, we are playing a somewhat intense group game of rotating six-on-six. One thing I love about Kathy is that she has expectations of her students. When she gets that intense Kathy-look in her eyes, like she’s coaching her D-I team, you know shit is about to go down. And when we are not trying, we get yelled at and, frankly, I like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Mircea Badulescu</strong><em> (Beginning Soccer)</em></p>\n<p>I kid you not; I had to look up his name on GOLD before typing this up. That’s the hands-off approach he takes, and it isn’t necessarily an insult. With an accent that awesome, you don’t need to talk quite so much. Soccer is called “The Beautiful Game” for a reason. It’s simple to pick up and it flows well, even if the talent level is not high. In class, this translates to playing soccer every time for the whole time. While it’s fun, I’m not learning how to do anything other than lose gracefully to really good players and that is not why I signed up for the class. I have already complained about the fools that ruin class with their superior talent, but no matter how you cut it, running around the grass for a solid 40 minutes is good cardio. At least I’m getting that.</p>\n<p><strong>Myself</strong></p>\n<p>I still don’t have washboard abs and I still get winded when I have to outrun the police on weekends, but I am getting better. An hour of soccer preceding an hour of tennis used to be brutal for me, but now I leave the latter wishing I could stay out there instead of going to class. I can carry a 30-rack all the way home from International without having to pretend it doesn’t burn and the activity in my school life has spilled over into my personal life, where I play squash with friends just for fun. The results might not be in my body just yet, but they are definitely in my head. For me, the fact that I can notice a difference at all is success enough at this point. There is definitely still a ways to go, but I can confidently say I’ve crested the hill of “fatassery.” The view from the top of Mt. Average Health is a beautiful one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-07/train-sports-editor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-07/train-sports-editor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-07/train-sports-editor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-07/train-sports-editor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-07/train-sports-editor/","id":2150,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[2149,2148,2147],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: When It Comes To Your Stick, Size Doesn’t Matter","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Let’s talk about your quiver.

The majority of pros and sponsored surfers have more boards than they can keep track of. Take my buddy ‘Steiny’ for example. He’s an UCSB student and a freakishly talented longboarder with style and grace that brings the sponsors flocking. He’s got the incredible privilege of calling up a world-class shaper and saying, “Hey dude, want to make me a sick new board?”</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the pile of old cast-away boards on the side of his house nearly outnumbers the grains of sand on the beach at Pescies. There are prototypes of new concepts and sleek modern templates along with classic ’70s throwbacks — all of them covered in stunning art and the heavenly odor of freshly cured fiberglass.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To the gifted bastards like Steiny, a custom board with the ideal dimensions is nothing special. Sometimes, the shelf life of a pro’s board is no longer than two weeks before it’s been given too much of a thrashing to perform to his skill level.</p>\n<p>The majority of us proletariat surfers have to dig deep into our pockets when we want to buy a stick, so the decision to get a new board can be a big deal. Shit, Al Merrick charges upwards of $800 for a new shortboard, and most college surfers just aren’t able to make that happen on the reg.</p>\n<p>While it’s true that the size, shape and thickness of a board can change the way it rides, you can’t believe all the hype all the time. If you were to walk into a surf shop and try chatting up a grizzled surf veteran about the right dimensions for you, you’ll get caught in a downward spiral of panic about choosing the correct tail, fin set-up and size of the board. But that’s not reality. For the casual or intermediate surfer, one board is usually sufficient.</p>\n<p>Sure, if you’re competing in the ASP World Tour with Kelly Slater, Mick Fanning, Jordy Smith, Dane Reynolds and Taj Burrow, that extra millimeter of extension you can push out of your board in turns might get you that extra .1 point you need in the rankings. For you and me, though, it’s just important that you are comfortable with the plexiglass under your feet.</p>\n<p>I’ve tried a wide variety of board designs, and I’ve found that the biggest factor contributing to my performance was not my equipment, not by a long shot. It’s the mindset, the enthusiasm and the physical conditioning.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the ancient Hawaiians responsible for the sport of kings. Their original surfboards were flat planks of wood that didn’t even have fins for stability through turns, yet they still managed to keep it elegant and stoke the surf fire in the decades to follow.</p>\n<p>Don’t let concerns for your equipment slow you down. Your true skill will come from your drive to make progress, regardless of the shape of your shred sled.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus surf columnist Elliott Rosenfeld has no concerns about his equipment, and neither should you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33421\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/nuglets-wisdom-stick-size-matter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33421\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/nuglets-wisdom-stick-size-matter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/nuglets-wisdom-stick-size-matter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/nuglets-wisdom-stick-size-matter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/nuglets-wisdom-stick-size-matter/","id":2149,"author":{"id":220,"name":"Elliott Rosenfeld"},"related":[2148,2147,2146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nuglets of Wisdom: The Tale of Tails","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"By Max Wilshinsky\r\nAn anal fissure is a small cut or tear in the thin sensitive tissue of the lower rectum.

It tends to hurt. Like most people, I was unaware of this before Veteran’s Day 2009.</p>\n<p>The parking lot at Jalama Beach County Park was empty for a national holiday, and there were some overhead sets down the beach. After an hour of fun surf, everything went wrong. A backhand snap turned into a fin-impaling, butthole-tearing nightmare.</p>\n<p>My friend Jace heard me shouting for help as I paddled into the beach. As I pulled my suit to my waist to check the extent of my injury, Jace pointed to the ground. Blood was streaming from my ankles and pooling in the sand. I took a few steps and fainted.</p>\n<p>I always liked the walk back from the reef to the parking lot. It let me reflect on my session and all the great waves I shared with my friends. That day was different. A twenty-minute walk turned into an hour-long shuffle.</p>\n<p>After I rinsed my tender bottom at the shower, I lay face down in the passenger seat while Jace loaded the truck. The drive back to SB was one of the most intense mental battles I have ever faced. Every slight bump and turn in the road forced my sphincter muscles to tighten, causing excruciating pain.</p>\n<p>By the time we arrived at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, I was panicking. Would I have to shit in a bag for the rest of my life? Were my surfing days over?</p>\n<p>After two hours, the first nurse responded to my moaning and pleading. Without warning, she yanked my butt cheeks open to analyze the damage. I screamed. She gasped.</p>\n<p>“You can’t yell like that around here,” she said, reaching for a syringe full of Dilaudid. She continued to explain that the cut extended into my rectum and that they could not perform the surgery. I needed to see a specialist at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>I was so high on painkillers by the time they transferred me to the next hospital that the mood seemed to switch from serious to festive. There were some foxy nurses in the new emergency room so I tried to make the conversation as entertaining as possible. Given the circumstances, there was no lack of comedic content.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the butt specialist was able to sew me back together with 16 stitches; 14 for the sphincter muscles and two for the rectum.</p>\n<p>When I woke up from surgery in my hospital bed four hours later, the patient in the bed next to mine was being discharged. The elderly gentleman whom he was with heard about my injury and was waiting for me to wake up. My memory was hazy from the drugs and his accent was thick, but I remember it being about doing what you love and living life. I was discharged the next day.</p>\n<p>For the next few months, I woke up every day to a bloody stool. Coughing, sneezing, laughing and getting those last drops out at the urinal were no longer minor tasks. Worst of all, I couldn’t surf for almost two months.</p>\n<p>When the doctor told me that I could get back in the water, he also told me I had to wear a watertight bandage. In order to do that I needed to remove any hair from the area. Stoked on the forecast for a solid west swell and itching to surf, I made my mom shave my butthole.</p>\n<p>The remainder of my recovery went pretty smoothly thanks to stool softeners and a carefully monitored diet. The doctors told me that I experienced a pain threshold similar to what women go through during childbirth. Careful, ladies. It’s no fun.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-08/nuglets-wisdom-tale-tails/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-08/nuglets-wisdom-tale-tails/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-08/nuglets-wisdom-tale-tails/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-08/nuglets-wisdom-tale-tails/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-08/nuglets-wisdom-tale-tails/","id":2151,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[2150,2149,2148],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
