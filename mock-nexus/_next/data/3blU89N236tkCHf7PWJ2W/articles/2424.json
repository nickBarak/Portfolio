Anderle, the judge who ruled that the student may return to school, said that the evidence in the case “suggests UCSB never made an effort to contact Jane Doe to corroborate the statements attributed to her.”</p>\n<p>John Doe’s suspension will remain lifted even if the university places charges against the freshman. The stay on the suspension will remain in effect “up to and including any final judgment in that case, after all appeals, if any,” according to Judge Anderle’s ruling.</p>\n<p>The court ruled that UCSB must also assist Doe by giving him full access to all programs and activities at UCSB with no restrictions, returning him to his assigned on-campus dorm room, allowing him to complete all classes, giving him priority enrollment and providing any assistance necessary from any of the university offices.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle said in his decision that the university took too long to investigate, failing to fulfill both the 60-calendar-day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60-business-day deadline agreed upon by the university.</p>\n<p>“The Court of Appeal found that the University’s inaction over such a lengthy period of time, leaving Petitioner in limbo, appears unreasonable and arbitrary,” Judge Anderle said in the court ruling.</p>\n<p>Judge Anderle ruled that the university had caused “irreparable harm” to the student by failing to conduct the investigation in a timely manner, leaving him suspended indefinitely.</p>\n<p>“This Court concludes that the University is intentionally doing indirectly what it is unwilling to do directly. The University has made a decision to deny John Doe the opportunity to enroll in the any [sic] of the first three quarters of his freshman year,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “But instead of making that decision based upon the facts, the law, and in fairness, it has decided to do it their own way.”</p>\n<p>According to Doe’s lawyer, Robert Ottilie, Doe moved into his on-campus dorm during Spring Break and said the university has been very helpful with the process of assimilating Doe to life in college.</p>\n<p>“They could not have been more helpful. The school has been responsive to the ruling,” Ottilie said.<br>\nUCSB spokeswoman Andrea Estrada said the university “will make every effort to ensure the student’s success” while they complete the adjudication process.</p>\n<p>“We respect the court’s rulings and have complied with the court’s order,” she said in an email.<br>\nOttilie said Doe is very happy with the decision because it now allows him to start his life, beginning with attending his “dream school.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he was not surprised by the judge’s ruling to remove Doe’s suspension, as he felt the law was clearly on his side.</p>\n<p>“It really wasn’t very much of a surprise. The law is very clear,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Doe has won his ruling to return to school, he still faces an ongoing investigation against him on behalf of the university, a lawsuit against that claim in court and several hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers’ fees that he must pay.</p>\n<p>According to the ruling, Doe has incurred over $100,000 in attorney’s fees and costs just through his filing in December of 2016. The ruling said he has “undoubtedly incurred substantially more in fees and costs since that time.”</p>\n<p>Ottilie said Doe is unable to pay that amount of money and does not expect him to pay the expenses anytime soon. Ottilie himself has incurred $50,000 of out-of-pocket costs from representing Doe against the university.</p>\n<p>As for what Doe will decide to study now that he has started school this Spring Quarter, Ottilie said he does not know what particular major the first-year will choose while at UCSB. Ottilie said it would not surprise him if Doe went on to study law later on.</p>\n<p>Ottilie also said he will continue to investigate abuses of the particular code in the Regents’ laws that the university has used to keep Doe and students in similar situations from attending school.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said new information has come out that suggests the university withheld information during the judicial process, so he also plans to amend the lawsuit to include four UCSB staff members involved in Doe’s 200-day suspension.</p>\n<p>Included in the proposed amendment are Kristi Johnson, principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office; Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs; Sandra Vasquez, associate dean of judicial affairs; and Brian Quillen, also principal investigative analyst of the Title IX office.</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university has not yet seen any amended complaint.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76691\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76691\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/","id":2424,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2423,2422,2421],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa","biography":"Not available","articles":[2286,2364,2385,2391,2392,2400,2404,2416,2419,2421,2424,2425,2429,2430,2443,3574,3584,3601,3737,3749,3756,3757,3763,3786,3801,3806,3908,3910,3920,3925,3926,3952,4280,4291,4313,4352,4357,4386,4387,4388,4389,4392,4393,4394,4395,4403,4404,4406,4408,4409,4423,4426,4435,4442,4449,4465,4489,7780],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Inspiring Student, Role Model Passes at Age 25","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-10-at-5.55.05-PM.png?resize=635%2C368&ssl=1","description":"Ismael Hernandez transferred from SBCC and was prepared to graduate from UCSB in June with a degree in biology.

It was a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez had a “wakeup call” at the age of 17, she said, when his mother passed away around the same time he faced incarceration in juvenile hall. He attended his mother’s funeral in handcuffs, and he realized soon after that he needed to change his life for the sake of his three younger siblings.</p>\n<p>“He knew that if he continued on the path of delinquency or anything like that, it wouldn’t lead him to be a great role model for his siblings,” Rodriguez said. “At the end of the day, that’s what his mom wanted him to be; she wanted him to go to school and do great things.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez later graduated from a continuation high school and went on to enroll in Transitions, a program at SBCC which seeks to provide educational opportunities to individuals released from the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>Noel Gomez, a Transitions program counselor, remembers Hernandez telling the class on the first day that he was going to graduate from SBCC with a degree in biological sciences, go on to UCSB and become a doctor.</p>\n<p>“I can’t tell you how many times I hear that from a lot of students. Within a semester, students drop out or they don’t carry on with their goals. He actually went on and did it,” Gomez said.<br>\nFrom then on, everyone in the class started calling him “the doctor,” Gomez said. Hernandez valued hard work and would often study in the library for hours on end.</p>\n<p>“He couldn’t understand why people would come to SBCC and not focus on school,” Gomez said. “He took that as an opportunity that a lot of people don’t have, and he wanted to use it.”</p>\n<p>After five years at SBCC, Hernandez became the first in his family to graduate from college. He applied and got accepted into his dream school, UCSB, where he continued his studies in biology.</p>\n<p>His classmate and close friend Kathy Lopez said he kept to his diligent study habits, which he had maintained at SBCC. He volunteered in the emergency room at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, and he had plans to go to nursing school after graduation.</p>\n<p>Lopez said she and Hernandez would often hang out together after their biology classes. She said he would always want to stop by Root 217 in the UCen so that he could get “that fish sandwich he always wanted.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said one of the fondest memories she has with Hernandez is when they were reflecting on graduation by the UCSB Lagoon.</p>\n<p>“We were walking over past the lagoon — it was a really nice day, actually, and the lagoon didn’t smell so bad either — and he just looked over at the lagoon and was like, ‘Kathy, we actually did this; we’re actually here and we’re actually graduating. We made it,’” she said, adding that the two of them paid a visit to Root 217 soon after.</p>\n<p>Hernandez worked as a cashier at a liquor store to support his education and family. His sister, Karinna Hernandez, said he often told customers that he would take care of them when he became a doctor.</p>\n<p>His sister also said he greatly valued his family and that he especially loved his nieces.</p>\n<p>“He used to love being with my kids,” she said. “Every time he saw them, he would always give them kisses, and he’d always hold my oldest daughter and tell her he could bless her. He would always kiss her hand and tell her it was his blessing.”</p>\n<p>Karinna Hernandez said her brother became a role model for the family. She said he often encouraged her to prioritize her education, helping her pick her classes at SBCC and advising her to sit at the front of her classes.</p>\n<p>“He was a caring person with a big heart,” she said. “His smile was something that I think nobody can forget. He was such a loving person.”</p>\n<p>Friends and family held a funeral service for Hernandez on March 16 at Our Lady of Guadalupe in Santa Barbara. He was buried with his bachelor’s degree in biological sciences.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ismael-hernandez-obit/","id":2422,"author":{"id":30,"name":"Josh Ortiz"},"related":[2421,2420,2419],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Mourns Loss of ‘Selfless’ Grad Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=661%2C468&ssl=1","description":"Samuel “Sam” Boldissar died on March 25 while rock climbing in Joshua Tree.

He was always rock climbing, always.”</p>\n<p>Jordan Hughes was a housemate of Boldissar and met him in 2014 when they began graduate school at UCSB. He said Boldissar came from a “family of climbers.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar enjoyed rock climbing, backpacking and camping. He also loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers, cooking and brewing his own beer.</p>\n<p>Hughes said Boldissar was “true to his own tastes” and interested in a variety of different things.</p>\n<p>“He spent his time on things he found intrinsically interesting,” Hughes said in an email. “He wasn’t in grad school for the degree. He did it because the problems he worked on were important and interesting to him.”</p>\n<p>A problem solver, Hughes said Boldissar once created a skunk trap in their backyard in Isla Vista. One night, he went to check on the trap and a skunk wandered into the house through the opened door.</p>\n<p>“Lots of yelling ensued and we miraculously avoided getting skunk spray in our house, but we did decide that the best defense was probably just to keep the door shut,” Hughes said in an email.</p>\n<p>Haley Snyder was Boldissar’s neighbor in Isla Vista and said “the best” she saw Boldissar was when they would sit in the living room “singing and playing drums.”</p>\n<p>“There’s not many people that you’re going to meet that were as genuine or as kind as Sam,” Snyder said.</p>\n<p>As an undergraduate transfer student at UCSB, Boldissar lived with seven other Isla Vistans: Patrick Sheehan, Paul Mazzella, Mike Wood, Tyler Rowe, Shelby Hendricks, Lewis Durand and Erik Romelfanger.</p>\n<p>Sheehan said the group lived together on the 68-block of Sabado.</p>\n<p>Sheehan and Mazzella explained how they once wrote a song for Boldissar titled, “Sammy Come Home,” because he was always working on campus at the Chemistry lab.</p>\n<p>“We ended up singing [the song] for the rest of the year and it sort of resonates right now,” Mazzella said.</p>\n<p>“We’d play it for him all the time and he’d think it was funny,” Sheehan added. “And now Sam has passed away and we want Sammy to come home. We loved him so much and wanted him around so much that we wrote a song about it.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca described Boldissar as “selfless” and said he “really just wanted to help anyone in need.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca said she and Boldissar went to Big Bear with friends and he helped a group of people get their car out of a ditch on the icy road.</p>\n<p>“Sam just walked over without a second thought … to go help these people, and he just got on the bumper and started pushing as hard as he could,” she said. “He’s the reason the car got out of the ditch. He did things like that all the time.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca and Boldissar were together for six months and she said they enjoyed taking walks on the beach and introducing each other to the things they each liked to do.</p>\n<p>Boldissar took Rebecca to the Santa Barbara Rock Gym and went to musicals like “Beauty and the Beast” because Rebecca loves musicals.</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries described Boldissar as “brilliant” and always willing to help other students in the research group with their own projects.</p>\n<p>“He was very good but in a humble way,” de Vries said. “He was involved in every project in the lab and helped every other student in the group.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar worked on multiple projects in the research group, and his most recent projects are being compiled for publication.</p>\n<p>“It’s wonderful his name is going to be in publications and in scientific journals,” Rebecca said. “I’m glad people are going to see the hard work he did.”</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries said he wants Boldissar to be remembered “with a smile.”</p>\n<p>“He always had this smile and everybody in our group is touched by him,” de Vries said. “He’s been so influential … [and] he had no idea how smart he was. There was never any showing off. It was just that smile.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar’s funeral will be held on April 22 at 11 a.m. at Redondo Union High School.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/","id":2423,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2422,2421,2420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Miller, 46, had worked at UC Santa Barbara as assistant publications coordinator for five years, during which he compiled and printed readers for UCSB courses.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, who supervises all of Associated Students, said, Miller was “certainly a beloved member of A.S.”</p>\n<p>Miller’s coworkers describe him as a dependable person who always got the job done. Marquez said Miller always followed through with his commitments.</p>\n<p>“One of my fondest memories of David is really being able to always be certain that whatever he committed to, he was going to have — he would follow through,” she said. “He was very, very true to his word.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said she enjoyed visiting Miller in his office because he would have photographs of his family, and anyone who knew him would know he loved spending time with them. Miller had a wife and two young children.</p>\n<p>Marquez said Miller enjoyed working with students at A.S. and had previously worked at Grafikart, a photocopying business in what is now the A.S. Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Austin Hechler said he fondly remembers Miller as a person who got things done.</p>\n<p>“He wasn’t just there to do his job, he was there to make sure that everyone excelled at their job as well,” Hechler said. “Whenever I came into A.S. Publications, he’d shake my hand with a firm handshake, always smiling, always laughing.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said he remembers working with Miller on his initiative to make college textbooks more affordable.</p>\n<p>“All-around, genuinely a good man. Someone you would hope to emulate if you were an incoming A.S. staffer,” Hechler said. “They should emulate him, how he talked to students, how he treated those people around them and really just his general attitude toward helping students with things.”</p>\n<p>Hechler said A.S. is considering honoring Miller by naming a scholarship or a part of the A.S. building after him.</p>\n<p>“I do know that there are talks within Senate to introduce a resolution or do something in his honor, so maybe name the Publications building after him or the room after him or maybe a scholarship after him, for whatever he was passionate about,” he said. “Definitely something that we could do within A.S. to solidify his memory and what he did and the service that he provided for all the student body.”</p>\n<p>Miller’s friends have set up a memorial fund on the crowdfunding site YouCaring. In lieu of flowers, the friends ask that people consider donating to the fund in support of Miller’s wife and two children.</p>\n<p>Students who are in need of mental health support can contact Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) at caps.sa.ucsb.edu or (805) 893-4411.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/a-s-remembers-staff-member-david-miller/","id":2421,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2420,2419,2418],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
