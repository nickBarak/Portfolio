The Cubs, having not won since 1908, and the Indians since 1948, gave both teams the intense motivation to push them to game seven. Each game, inning, and play has kept baseball fans across the nation glued to their televisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading by three at the top of the eighth inning, the Cubs had reason to feel confident, but leave it to the Indians to come back from behind when pressure is on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the first World Series to be tied in the ninth inning since 1991 between the Twins and the Braves, according to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These two knock-out teams managed to keep it tied and send the game into extra innings, stirring up every Cubs and Tribe fan alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here it was, the 10th inning that will go down in Cubs baseball history. Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw  intentionally walks Anthony Rizzo, a hitting all-star this post-season, as well as Addison Russell,  to prevent any chance of hits from these two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist slammed double into left field, sending Albert Amora Jr. home to push the Cubs ahead. Miguel Montero, then singles, knocked Rizzo home for another run. The Cubs headed into the bottom of the 10th with just three outs standing between them and their first World Series title in over a century. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd has seen this scenario before in the eighth inning when the Indians were able to turn it around; the real question was would they be able to pull it off again in the 10th?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carl Edwards Jr., Cubs reliever, managed to snag two outs. But with one left, the Indians scored as right-handed hitter Rajai Davis smacked a line drive to center field. Mike Montgomery enters as the Cubs attempt to clench one last out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within two pitches, the Chicago Cubs had made history. It took every member of the team, both offensively and defensively, to achieve what this group has achieved, and the victory is oh so sweet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist, Cubs second baseman, and seasoned player, was named Series MVP after his hit in the 10th-inning of game seven that changed baseball history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zobrist was most recently a Kansas City Royal and helped in winning the 2015 World Series. His presence on the field as a defender has made quite the impression, causing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usatoday.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to call him a “super utility player,” as well as his stellar record as a switch-hitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cubs coaches and administrators alike have called Zobrist a professional and role model both on and off the field — both from his “work ethic” to “clubhouse professionalism.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A close runner-up would have been Rizzo as he played an enormous role in leading his team to victory, but the second baseman’s title was well earned. Ben Zobrist is a name no Cubs fan will ever forget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This National League powerhouse team was chosen early in the 2016 season as a team to watch and has now surpassed all expectations and crushed all doubts. Congratulations to the 2016 World Series Champions, finally, the Chicago Cubs!</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

She began her collegiate career playing outside hitter in all 27 of UCSB’s matches, something that, as a first-year, gave her insight into the importance of hard work.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely a big transition coming from high school to college; every athlete knows that,” Hoffman said. “The biggest thing is that as soon as you come in, you have to have the same maturity as everyone else. Once you’re in college, age doesn’t matter. You have to just work for your spot.”</p>\n<p>Hoffman immediately proved herself a worthy contributor on the court, and by season’s end, she’d racked up almost 230 kills on an average of 2.34 per set, both of which ranked in the top four on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgement for her play would come soon, as she was awarded Big West Freshman of the Week honors, earned a place on the All-Big West Freshman Team and received an honorable mention for the All-Big West Team itself.</p>\n<p>“It was a great experience,” Hoffman reminisced. “I was able to play with all the seniors that left, and I learned a lot from them.”</p>\n<p>The team found decent success with a 13-14 overall record and an 8-8 mark in conference play. While slightly down from the wildly successful 2013 season in which the Gauchos went 13-3 and won a share of the Big West crown, the season was a useful development period for Hoffman and UCSB’s other younger players.</p>\n<p>After such a stellar start to her UCSB career, Hoffman’s continued improvement was seemingly inevitable in her sophomore campaign.</p>\n<p>Through non-conference play last season, her game was clearly growing and becoming more efficient. While Hoffman’s offensive production dropped somewhat with only 1.95 kills per set in her sophomore campaign, her kill percentage rose from .138 in her first-year season to .221 in her second.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 25, the Gauchos were handed a 3-0 sweep by a Hawaii team that would go on to an undefeated conference schedule. Hoffman lead the team that night with seven kills and only one error on 18 attacks (.333 kill percentage) and added 11 digs.</p>\n<p>“It was such a sudden injury,” Hoffman recalled. “I actually played on it the rest of the match. It was in a tournament here, and then we travelled to Hawaii and I played on it there. I found out after we came back.”</p>\n<p>After learning that she’d torn her PCL, Hoffman would have to begin the long road to recovery.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73476\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2062297678\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73498\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73476\" data-attachment-id=\"73476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/wvball_vsucd-161006-dustinharris-04-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C2400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"wvball_vsucd-161006-dustinharris-04-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73476\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WVball_vsUCD-161006-DustinHarris-04-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=335%2C502\" alt=\"Chanel Hoffman serves with topspin to the deep corner.

Both marks rank ninth in the Big West, as she’s established herself as one of the best outside hitters in the conference. She’s been killing her attacks at a .237 mark, and is one of five UCSB players in the Big West’s top 25 for the statistic.</p>\n<p>The junior outside hitter is tied for 11th in the conference with 19 service aces on the season (.24 per set), and her offensive dominance in the 2016 season has notched her seventh in the Big West with 3.8 points per set.</p>\n<p>Hoffman’s 2.35 digs per set are an improvement of 1.52 from her mark in the previous season and of 0.42 over her first-year campaign. The defense from the outside makes Hoffman a consistent double-double threat, and her presence at the net to the tune of 0.54 blocks per set further contributes to her role as one of the league’s most all-around players.</p>\n<p>“The coaches really push us in the gym and in the weight room,” Hoffman said. “I’ve been helped by the athletic trainers especially to get back [physically].”</p>\n<p>Team chemistry has also helped Hoffman reach personal success.</p>\n<p>“We have a really good team dynamic,” Hoffman said. “All of the freshmen coming in have key roles on the team, and I’m really proud of them.”</p>\n<p>The team has focused heavily on creating that team dynamic this season. With all the young talent on the roster, creating team unity has proved its most valuable tool.</p>\n<p>“C3HD: commitment, confidence, communication, happiness, determination,” Hoffman said. “That’s really been our motto all season, and it’s really helped us.”</p>\n<p>With seven conference games left, the Gauchos are hoping to win out and claim a spot in the NCAA postseason. The young Gaucho squad has shown serious flashes, including taking the league leading Long Beach State 49ers to a fifth set this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“One of our goals is to win the Big West, and it’s still possible,” Hoffman declared. “We really want to get to the NCAA tournament, and I believe we can as long as we keep winning and keep this streak.”</p>\n<p>Whatever success the Gauchos are able to have toward the end of this season, it will be a direct cause of the consistent excellence and unity that Hoffman has helped foster. With the injury behind her, success is the only thing that lies ahead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 and continued on page 9 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/steady-attack-hoffmans-gradual-ascension/","id":1917,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1916,1915,1914],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"How Klopp Made Liverpool Contenders in Less than a Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liverpool1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Five games into the next season, now led by Jurgen Klopp—a genius of high-pressing football and a cultural icon that seems to breathe belief and hope into LFC and it’s fans—and the Reds are flyi...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A year ago, the red half of Merseyside was reeling just weeks before Brendan Rodgers would be sacked as Liverpool took just 12 points from the first eight games of the ’15-’16 season.

His lack of depth in the back wasn’t suited to the high-intensity style. His midfield lacked burning pace. His frontline was too thin and Daniel Sturridge suffered from injuries most of the season.</p>\n<p>This summer was the first time Klopp was able to buy and sell players from his squad to real effect — January isn’t the best time for a rebuild by any means — and the German bought perfectly.</p>\n<p>He brought Sadio Mane that gives them a winger that’s proving to be one of the Premier League’s finest players. Before Mane arrived, Liverpool was loaded with creative attacking midfielders in Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana, but lacked someone who could just blow past defenders and run in behind effectively. The purchase of Georginio Wijnaldum from Newcastle also brought balance to the midfield with his top-class workrate and skillful distribution.</p>\n<p>Joël Matip on a free transfer and goalkeeper Loris Karius for under five million pounds could eventually develop the Reds into one of the hardest teams to score on as well. Matip was a first-choice center-back in FC Shalke 04’s side for nearly seven years, and has played in two World Cups for Cameroon despite only being 25 years old. Karius, the 23-year-old new boy from Mainz, was voted by Bundesliga players in a poll by Kicker to be the second best goalkeeper in the league, trailing only worlds’s best, Manuel Neuer.</p>\n<p>Klopp didn’t completely rebuild his squad at all; in fact, he kept every core player from last year’s team, but the additions he made were crucial. Each one was well-considered and filled a recognizable gap in Rodgers’s version of Liverpool.</p>\n<p>The biggest question asked of Liverpool this season has been of their ability, or inability, to kill off games against the Prem’s worst sides, highlighted by their 2-0 loss to Burnley. It must be noted, though, that four of the Reds’ first five games came against Champions-League-caliber teams, and, in all three of their wins, Klopp’s men have simply looked the better team.</p>\n<p>The smiling Jurgen Klopp has put Liverpool back on the tip of people’s tongues by creating a team capable of a burst of goals rivaled only by the world’s superclubs. Combined with the emotion of the Anfield faithful, the revived Reds have already shared what’s to come. Last season’s win against Manchester City and a magical comeback against Dortmund to advance to the Europa League final were just samples of the inevitable glory to come.</p>\n<p>When watching LFC play at home, the German manager has created a bond between players and fans that just oozes confidence and a belief in a club’s project as great as what’s present at Liverpool is almost unrecognizable in modern football. The players trust the coach and the coach trusts the players. The fans shouldn’t expect to win the league, but there’s plenty of reason to hope.</p>\n<p>Klopp brought two legendary Bundesliga titles to Dortmund over the Bavarian giants Bayern Munich, etching his name in football history, but one would be a fool to assume he’s done winning, especially with his team beginning to look as clinical as his title-winning sides this early in the Premier League season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73110\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73110\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/how-klopp-made-liverpool-contenders-in-less-than-a-year/","id":1916,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1915,1914,1913],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate through a resolution authored by Letters and Science Senator Olivia Campos and Off-Campus Senator Tianna White; however, it was Sir who first proposed the idea during her presidential campaign in the Spring Quarter 2019 election.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re keeping it simple,” Sir said to the Nexus, explaining that ideally, the app will have two main features: a “feed” with all Office of Student Life (OSL) organizations and A.S. events </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">similar to other social media apps, with reminders that can be customized to each student </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a notification system that would inform students of free food available on campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is, for example, a “catered event on campus with lots of leftover food” the app would then alert students, Sir explained. Users can also input their food preferences into the app and indicate any food allergies they might have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is gonna be the hook that brings people in,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, who has spoken to the Nexus several times regarding the project, said her goal is to bring “A.S. out of the dark ages” with the app, which would contain all A.S. and OSL-related sources in one place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White’s resolution echoed several of Sir’s points, stating A.S. resources “are in need of being updated and more readily available to the student body.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The student body does not have a cohesive source of information regarding Associated Students and the Office of Student Life events and meetings,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos said that Sir initially approached the Senate a few weeks ago, looking for the senators’ support for her project. Campos and White then offered to write the resolution in support of the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The app] follows closely with a lot of things we hoped to accomplish as a 70th Senate,” Campos said to the Nexus. She added that she believes the app will make it easier for students to see the programs and resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Senate’s meeting on Wednesday night, College of Engineering Senator Diana Reyes Carrillo brought up her concerns about the app, pointing out that creating it would be “time consuming” and that it is “naive” to start the process of creating an app if there “hasn’t been research if students want one.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes Carrillo abstained from the final vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hiring of a developer would be handled by A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez, according to the resolution. During Senate, Internal Vice President Alli Adam explained that a “significant portion” of the app has already been built by UCSB Information Technology (I.T.) and that a software developer would bring the “final touch.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that Márquez plans to hire a developer within two months but does not know how long it will take the hired developer to finish the work started by I.T. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
