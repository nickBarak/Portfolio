Their students, in turn, are unable to access several tools, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elrod said there is a “variety of benefits” that employees get, but the lack of registration has resulted in them not receiving the benefits to which they are entitled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UAW 2865 and Graduate Student Association (GSA) have been working together in an attempt to help students avoid losing benefits and payment for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve written up a collective survey together that we’ve been circulating on our list serves, sending to our department reps in GSA on Facebook, trying to get as many graduate students as possible who are having issues to respond to it,” GSA President Cierra Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student workers] should also recognize that the only way to speak to the university as an equal would be through… [a] collective response,” Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCPath malfunction has also affected undergraduate students who work within the school as tutors or readers, according to Daniel Lazar, one of the UAW 2865 Head Stewards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union stated that they are working closely with the GSA to make sure students do not feel as though they are isolated and to make sure the university upholds their end of the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The larger issue is whether students will band together to bring attention to the issue, Elrod said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lazar also expressed frustration over the university’s lack of quick and detailed responses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’ve just been stonewalling and haven’t responded. I’ve actually gotten contradictory information about the causes of the error… It’s clearly a university-wide problem, and there hasn’t been a university-wide response to it,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Union objected to the transition to UCPath from the start because these issues had already occurred at other universities last year. Despite this, the university proceeded with the transition, McClelland said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the issues are not resolved soon, UCPath members will not receive their October paychecks, leaving students unsure of their ability to pay rent, according to McClelland.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.6 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the</i>

CSD motioned at its Sept. 25 meeting to ask that Bird not operate in I.V. until a county ordinance was developed. </span><em>Sicheng Weng / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman, who spoke at the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting Tuesday evening, said Bird had picked up 80 of its scooters and paid the $24 impound fee per scooter about two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The impound fee is] a standard fee that a student would pay or anyone would pay,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Police Department (UCPD) did not begin stringently impounding scooters until Dec. 3, Bowman said. While the university was putting together its interim policy, there was a warning period for scooters being ridden or found on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD began impounding scooters on a complaint basis for approximately a month after the warning period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[One] was parked in a handicapped zone. So somebody called that into the university police department and we went and picked it up to make that space available,” he said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then, as the number of reported serious injuries result[ing] from local scooters [increased], coupled with national media coverage of how scooters were impacting communities across the nation, we stepped up our enforcement and started impounding more scooters on campus property.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several students have been fined for riding scooters on campus, which could cost them as much as $200, as per California legal code. UC Santa Barbara reminded students of the potential fine in an email sent out Dec. 10. The university also put up several posters around campus, particularly in the residence halls, as another reminder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one instance, Bowman said, a student was offered the opportunity to either pay a reduced fine of $175 or complete community service. The student chose the latter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman also said several students have been injured riding scooters on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One was a significant gash to the forehead, that I’m sure required many stitches,” he said.  “The second was, from the pictures I could tell it was road rash, but the student was in a [cervical collar], or there was obvious concern of spinal injury.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman has only seen photos of two incidents, but confirmed that there have been several other scooter-related accidents on campus as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta City Council implemented a ban on electric scooters in Goleta on Dec. 4, noting that Bird and Lime have a history of bringing their scooters to communities without the approval of local governments, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/goleta_council_votes_unanimously_to_ban_motorized_scooters\"> reported</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V.

They also asked that Bird work with the district and other stakeholders to “mitigate negative impacts of its launch and actively work towards the public benefit.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before the I.V. CSD could meet with Bird representatives, the scooters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1045468577036296192\">launched</a> in I.V. on Sept. 27. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the CSD’s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhR6nprhAbHvmWoXQ2TI0xNj7ejKp4a7CdMIuK2DHbs/edit?fbclid=IwAR0f_mhzHEYh5I944a-hXiF54j8i-0FIQox939-6cxnQIet7zN2uUyf3kR8#heading=h.3remlxj1sk6u\">special meeting</a> on Oct. 30, they elected to present a set of recommendations to the County, supporting the use of electric scooters in I.V. with some stipulations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB has yet to implement a formal policy, although it put in place an interim <a href=\"https://www.policy.ucsb.edu/sites/www.policy.ucsb.edu/files/docs/policies/Interim_Electronic_Scooter_Policy.pdf\">policy</a> on Sept. 7 that <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/birds-wings-clipped-electric-scooter-ban-in-place-on-campus/\">banned</a> the scooters on campus property and gave UCPD the power to impound them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowman said he’s seen less ridership on campus since the enhanced enforcement on campus, although it has led to other problems such as the creation of piles of scooters at campus boundaries like Pardall Tunnel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People will utilize them in Isla Vista for example, get that far, stop, end their ride, get off and then walk on campus,” Bowman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though it is potentially impactful to the chokepoints there, overall, from a campus safety standpoint, that seems like a win.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Bowman said UCSB and campus leadership will have to see what the next steps are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are conscientious of the student population primarily that’s interested in having these as an available mode of transportation, but we have to always weigh that desire against public safety, being in law enforcement.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Trump administration’s proposed redefinition of gender would leave transgender students at UC Santa Barbara stuck in limbo between federal and state guidelines, according to Craig Leets, Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity director.</p>\n<p>Leets said the proposed redefinition, which defines gender as the sex assigned at birth, would cause complications particularly with passports, social security cards and insurance benefits.</p>\n<p>He has been working to advocate for LGBTQ students in higher education since 2012.</p>\n<p>“It’s really complicated for a trans person to get their gender marker with the federal government,” he said. “If [the redefinition] were to go through, there would be no chance at all for a trans person to change that gender marker that is on record with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>Transgender students travelling internationally run the risk of being held up in airports, both domestically and internationally.</p>\n<p>“Their appearance might align with one gender and [if] their gender marker on their passport says something different, that can cause problems for people who are going through customs,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies that operate across state lines would also be able to deny transgender students’ benefits, particularly to cover mental health or transitioning expenses, despite California’s more progressive laws.</p>\n<p>“Many things are more than just state-specific… which is where federal guidelines come in,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>California Senate Bill 179, which was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in Oct. 2017, would allow California residents three options for their gender on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates: male, female and nonbinary, which is denoted by an ‘x.’</p>\n<p>The law fully goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2019, but the Trump administration’s attempts to redefine gender could override the state law.</p>\n<p>“If the federal government were to change that definition it could really impact all of the progress that has been made,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>On UCSB’s campus, students would not see any effects to the protections they are already afforded by the university and the state of California.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has a nondiscrimination policy, and there are a set of protected classes who are legally protected in the state of California… so someone cannot be discriminated against in accessing housing or employment based on their gender, gender identity or gender expression,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“So our nondiscrimination policy, which aligns with those protected classes here in the state of California, would not be impacted or affected.”</p>\n<p>The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) is currently working on two efforts to support transgender students on campus: first, by providing a community-building space for trans students on campus and second, by implementing policy changes within the university.</p>\n<p>Currently, the center is working on cataloging the number and location of all-gender restrooms on campus. They are also trying to expand the preferred name option on Gaucho On-Line Data (G.O.L.D.) to include pronouns.</p>\n<p>According to Leets, there are approximately 70 all-gender restrooms on campus, with the majority of those being single-stall restrooms.</p>\n<p>Through the RCSGD’s work to establish a map of all-gender restrooms on campus, it has identified a corridor on Ocean Road by the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education and Robertson Gym where there are several buildings without a single all-gender restroom.</p>\n<p>“If a student is in one of those classes, one of those buildings or they have multiple classes in those buildings, it’s really hard for them to find a restroom space that’s close enough by for them to get between classes or for them to go during a class,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>Ideally, Leets would like to establish several all-gender restrooms in all buildings on campus, but says the more realistic goal is at least one in every building “so a student or faculty or staff-person would not have to leave the building that they’re in to have an accessible restroom option.”</p>\n<p>The RCSGD is currently in the inventory phase of the project. Once it identifies priority spots, like the Ocean Road corridor, it will begin requesting funding and approval to convert existing restrooms to all-gender restrooms.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center is also working with the university to expand the preferred name option already available for students.</p>\n<p>For students who have not or cannot change their legal name, they can currently change their preferred name on G.O.L.D. This change will be reflected in numerous locations including their access card, GauchoSpace, G.O.L.D., advising records, the online campus directory and housing rosters.</p>\n<p>“In many places, students will be able to see their preferred name and not have to interact with their legal name. That system is pretty good; we’re just trying to make sure it’s as good as it needs to be,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>As a partner project, they are also working toward including pronouns in the university system in the same places the preferred name already appears.</p>\n<p>Despite the work they’ve already done, projects like these often take longer than the center hopes them to.</p>\n<p>“I think many people want to do that work [to support trans students] and are excited to do that work … The challenge that comes from any large organization [is], ‘Is the money there?’, ‘What’s the technical complications of making these changes,’” he said.</p>\n<p>Leets said the center works closely with Vice Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Associate Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Maria Herrera-Sobek.</p>\n<p>“Our role on campus is to be the leaders of the advocacy and improvement on campus for trans students,” Leets said.</p>\n<p>“[The administration is] supporting the work that we are doing and help[s] us to make movement when we can’t ourselves to try and make campus more welcoming for trans students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

id=\"caption-attachment-84938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Wikicommons</p></div>\n<p>According to CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, the Arbor is the first store on the UCSB campus at which students can use CalFresh.</p>\n<p>CalFresh, also known as the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.), gives eligible individuals electronically distributed monetary benefits every month which can be spent at specified local markets or grocery stores, according to the official website of the California Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p>The website also states that participants of the program are administered Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Cards which they can use to purchase food items at stores that accept CalFresh.</p>\n<p>“At UCSB, we estimate that about 10,000 students are eligible for CalFresh, and if you’re eligible, you may get up to $192 a month,” Melissa Fontaine, the food security coordinator at UCSB, said.</p>\n<p>During the 2016-17 academic school year, the UCSB CalFresh Team enrolled roughly 600 students in CalFresh, and 3,000 students in the following year, according to Fontaine.</p>\n<p>This year the CalFresh team hopes to enroll 6,000 students in the program by the end of Spring Quarter, Fontaine said.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor happened largely because the UCSB Sustainability Program saw student need for more affordable food options.</p>\n<p>UCSB CalFresh Advocate Stephanie Perez, a fourth-year psychology major, echoed this sentiment both as a representative of CalFresh and a participant in the program.</p>\n<p>“I actually grew up with food stamps, so I’m very familiar with the CalFresh program,” Perez said. “Without food stamps, I don’t think my family would’ve gotten through, especially since I come from a low-income household.”</p>\n<p>Now, as a UCSB student, Perez notes that CalFresh provides a new mobility and convenience to students that may not have been able to afford grabbing a quick snack in between classes at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>“Especially during midterms or maybe finals or maybe throughout the day, students sometimes don’t have time to go grocery shopping or don’t have time to go get a snack at home,” she said.</p>\n<p>Christian Ortiz Gonzalez, a fifth-year sociology and german studies major, was also heavily involved in bringing CalFresh to the school.</p>\n<p>“I decided to work on getting EBT accepted at UCSB because I saw a dire need for it,” Ortiz Gonzalez said in an email to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Ortiz Gonzalez said he worked with several UCSB administrators and staff to help implement the program on campus.</p>\n<p>The new availability of CalFresh at the Arbor also follows a recent shift in the on-campus stigma surrounding the CalFresh program, which resulted from effective tabling and campaigning on the part of the CalFresh team, Perez said.</p>\n<p>“I think now, to be honest, UCSB has normalized what CalFresh is…I’ve heard a lot of people say, ‘Hey, how have do you not have CalFresh,’ like ‘You need to get on CalFresh.’”</p>\n<p>Fontaine stated she wanted to wait until the Arbor staff was fully trained on how to properly process CalFresh payments before making a public announcement about CalFresh’s availability.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important for the Arbor that their systems and staff are ready to go before students come to start spending their EBT CalFresh cards here at the Arbor because we want to make sure that everyone has a really great experience.”</p>\n<p>Now that CalFresh is available at the Arbor, Perez hopes the program will spread to other markets and food stores on campus.</p>\n<p>Fontaine said the spread of the program will “benefit both students and stores.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s say our school year last year ended with about 3,000 students who were eligible [for CalFresh] and they were getting $120 a month [through the CalFresh program],” she said. “That becomes $360,000 that could be spent, and is likely to be spent, in the local community. And over the course of the year, that’s over four million dollars.”</p>\n<p>“That would benefit business like the Arbor, Tenaya Market, the Isla Vista Food Co-op… Their sales will increase because students now have more purchasing power, so that’s tremendous.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 15, 2018, print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated [Jan. 2, 2019]: This article was updated to include information about Gonzalez. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84937\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84937\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/","id":2193,"author":{"id":33,"name":"Isabell Liu"},"related":[2192,2191,2190],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
