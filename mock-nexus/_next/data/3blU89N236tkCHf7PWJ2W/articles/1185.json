Defeating Missouri Saturday evening was the one bright spot in the Gauchos’ weekend, eking out a 6-5 victory before concluding the tournament on Sunday with losses to Washington and Arizona State by scores of 10-2 and 8-0 respectively.</p>\n<p>A beautiful afternoon in Palm Springs was the backdrop for the toughest loss of the weekend for the Gauchos, a game in which they lead or shared the lead until the bottom of the sixth inning. Veronika Gulvin started and went the full six innings for UCSB, a decent effort for the sophomore who surrendered four earned runs and finished with a hefty WHIP of 2.00.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Oklahoma Head Coach Kenny Gajewski took out his sophomore starting pitcher Barbie Biggerstaff midway through the first frame, replacing her with junior Whitney Whitehorn, who would go on to toss four-and-a-third scoreless innings.</p>\n<p>After a pair of walks in the top of the fourth, the Gauchos were able to break a 2-2 tie during an odd sequence of events that included freshman infielder Kayla Krantz striking out, freshman catcher Kaitlin Barry getting thrown out at second base and Genesis Ramirez, another freshman infielder, still coming in to score from third.</p>\n<p>Two runs on a trio of Cowboy singles was the nail in the coffin for UCSB. However, as freshman Logan Simunek — who relieved Whitehorn in the sixth inning — forced a ground out, pop out and strike out to end what would be the Gauchos’ closest loss of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Freshman Felisha Noriega took the mound to face the Volunteers Thursday night, and though she was able to accomplish the second complete game by a Gaucho pitcher on the day, her eight runs allowed (six earned) — especially the final five, which all came in the fourth inning or later — proved to be all Tennessee needed to pull out an 8-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Alyssa Diaz was the star of the game for the Gauchos, going 2-3 with all three of UCSB’s RBI, including a first-inning, two-run blast over the left field wall. Tennessee’s junior shortstop Meghan Gregg was there to outdo her, though, batting 2-4 with a home run, double and four RBI on the evening.</p>\n<p>Tennessee sophomore Matty Moss improved her record to 6-0 on the season (half of the Volunteers’ wins after Thursday’s contest), throwing all seven innings, striking out 10 batters and allowing only five hits and no walks.</p>\n<p>UCSB played another tough one against Purdue Friday, in which a neck-and-neck game was blown open in the top of the fifth with a flurry of Boilermaker scores. The four-run outbreak, centered on a bases-loaded double by junior catcher Kaylah Hampton, all but guaranteed the Gauchos’ third loss to start the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Boilermakers’ inferior record (this victory was only their second of the season), made this loss particularly painful for the Gauchos, especially since their bats were just beginning to come to life.</p>\n<p>Sophomore infielder Sierra Altmeyer rocked a second-inning solo home run, while Diaz was able to accumulate a double and an RBI for the second-straight game. Junior right fielder Jessica Johnston also grabbed a double of her own, and redshirt freshman Whitney Pemberton hit home a baserunner for only the fourth time this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally got a positive result Saturday night, earning victory in a miraculous, comeback fashion. Down three entering the seventh and final inning, two of the first three Gaucho batters were retired on infield groundouts, but senior outfielder Stacy Cavazos was able to make her way on base after being hit by a pitch.</p>\n<p>With two outs on the scoreboard, the magic began. Jessica Johnston singled, advancing Cavazos to third, and after a ball hit to left field by Diaz, both went on to score on an error by sophomore Raime Cohen, who’d just subbed in to begin the inning.</p>\n<p>Altmeyer came to the plate with the Gauchos down two and Diaz on second base. With the game on the line, she crushed a pitch from sophomore Danielle Baumgartner into the left-field bleachers, finally assuring the Gauchos their first victory of the weekend. The two-run shot was Altmeyer’s second of the day and third in the past two games, though surprisingly those are her only three of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB lost in five innings in both of its Sunday matchups, falling 10-2 to the Washington Huskies and 8-0 to the Arizona State Sun Devils.</p>\n<p>Noriega couldn’t make it through the first inning of the Washington game, forcing the Gauchos to look past Noriega and Gulvin to freshman Lilliana Rodriguez and junior Lena Mayer, UCSB’s two lightly used pitchers. The duo surrendered nine runs (eight earned) in just three and a third innings.</p>\n<p>Gulvin was back to start the Arizona State game, but after allowing a two-run home run and hitting a batter in the second frame, the ball was again handed to Noriega, who went on to let in five more runs. She finished the next three innings, but the Gauchos’ complete inability to generate any offense sealed their fate and concluded a disappointing weekend for UCSB.</p>\n<p>While there have been glimpses of power hitting, consistent play and strong pitching for the Gauchos, this team has a long way to go if they are to climb back to the .500 mark and make 2017 a winning season. The team cannot continue to allow opponents such drastic, early leads, and the lineup must start generating more extra-base hits.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos hope March has clearer skies in store, and will begin their climb back to success against Utah Valley, Iowa State, Nevada, Southern Utah and Nebraska Omaha next weekend at the St. George Red Desert Classic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Even Al Horford — a second-tier free agent — turned down a massive four-year offer from the Kings, opting to take less money and join a proven contender with the 76ers.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given these limitations, it’s no real surprise that the Kings received little to no media attention during the offseason; after all, the NBA is a superstar-driven league, and the Kings were (predictably) unable to grab one this offseason. But under the radar, the Kings may have had one of the smartest free agencies in recent memory, setting the team up for success in the coming years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of overpaying for a second-tier superstar, the Kings bet that their current core of De’Aaron Fox, Marvin Bagley III and Buddy Hield will take another step forward this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his jump shot is still inconsistent, Fox showed off the tantalizing skill set last year that made him the No. 5 pick two years ago. Fox averaged 17.3 points per game and 7.3 assists per game but — perhaps most importantly — shot an impressive 37% from behind the arc. If teams start to respect Fox’s jump shot, he can utilize his athleticism to get to the hoop at will.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hield, meanwhile, did his best Steph Curry impression last year, leading the team with 20.7 points per game while shooting 42% from three. One of the best pure shooters in the NBA, Hield should again provide excellent floor spacing for the Kings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite being the most raw of the three, Bagley showcased his versatility and athleticism last year while only playing 25 minutes per game in his rookie season. Even without an effective jump shot, Bagley averaged almost 15 points per game — thanks in large part to his willingness to run the floor with Fox.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still a superstar league, last years’ Raptors proved the importance of depth in making a postseason run. With the skill sets of these three in mind, the Kings made a myriad of shrewd signings to provide the team with the talent and depth necessary to compete in a loaded western conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, the Kings locked up Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $85 million contract. Considering the five-year, $180 million contract Tobias Harris signed with the 76ers, this deal feels like an incredible value. Somehow, Barnes is still only 27, and in his 28 games with the Kings last year, he shot the three at almost a 41% clip. With his athleticism and size, Barnes can guard multiple positions, making him a valuable defensive asset. Most importantly, the contract is front-loaded, meaning that the Kings will have the necessary cap space to resign their big three when they hit free agency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of Barnes, all of the Kings’ free agency moves revolved around creating a solid bench unit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dewayne Dedmon is a stretch five who averaged almost 11 points for the Hawks last year, displaying a natural shooting touch that should create space for the Kings’ athletic guards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trevor Ariza is a veteran who has proven his worth time and time again, and while he struggled last year with both the Suns and the Wizards, he should be more engaged on a much more competitive team. Only two years ago, Ariza proved his worth on the Rockets, and his size and acumen make him an above-average defender, as well as a solid veteran to mentor the younger players on the roster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, while the signing may not be attractive, Cory Joseph will provide the Kings with a steady hand to run the second unit when Fox needs a breather. Joseph will never put up gaudy numbers, but his 3.9:1 assist-to-turnover ratio from last year shows his reliability and willingness to find open teammates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The caveat for these moves, of course, is the abundance of talent in the western conference. Even with their newfound depth, the Kings will have to battle just to make the playoffs in one of the deepest conferences in recent memory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the Kings made all the necessary moves to compete as a small market team. If Fox, Hield and Bagley can take a step forward, there is no reason this team can’t make the playoffs next year and even compete in a seven-game series against a top team.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

Complementing these school records were 25 home runs and 256 RBIs in the team’s 56 game schedule. The longest winning streak the Gauchos managed to attain throughout the season was over the span of four games during their non-conference schedule which began at the Stacy Winsberg Invitational. In addition, on four separate occasions the Gauchos achieved a three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the season, the Gauchos had both impressive collective performances as a team and from individual players. The young, raw talent this team possessed managed to contribute to multiple victories this season and formed a foundation that will continue to benefit the team for years to come.</p>\n<p>Various players on the team emerged with admirable performances throughout the year. Senior infielder Arianna Palomares had a great end to her softball career ranking second in totals of 30 runs scored, 37 RBIs, 55 hits and 10 doubles which tied sophomore Jessica Johnston as a team-high.</p>\n<p>While batting third in the Gaucho lineup, she delivered clutch hits all year long and showed durability by playing in all 56 games and leading the team in at-bats with 180.  By the end of the season, Palomares had a .363 on base percentage, a .411 slugging percentage and a .306 batting average.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for UCSB, junior outfielder Kristen Clark will return for one more season, as she has been a valuable asset and leadoff hitter on this team since her freshman year. Clark made big improvements this season, earning multiple team highs and personal records of her own. Clark excelled with an outstanding .402 batting average for third best in the Big West, finished with an incredible .457 on base percentage and a .447 slugging percentage. Hitting atop the Gaucho lineup, Clark also led the team with 41 runs, 72 hits and 17 stolen bases.</p>\n<p>Freshman infielder Sierra Altmeyer played at a veteran level in her first season as a Gaucho, tallying a team high 42 RBIs to rank third in conference play, and performed best when under pressure. Altmeyer had a team high 12 doubles and seven home runs while scoring 20 runs, and led the team with 20 extra base hits. Often batting cleanup, she finished the season with a whopping .500 slugging percentage, a .297 batting average and drew 22 walks to lead the team alongside Johnston.</p>\n<p>Aside from tying for the team lead in walk, sophomore outfielder Jessica Johnston had an overall stellar year, and should be a force in the heart of the Gaucho lineup for years to come. She finished with a solid .322 batting average and a commanding .418 on-base percentage, both good for second on the team.</p>\n<p>The second year player also led the team with three triples, was second with six stolen bases and had 14 extra base hits. As stepping into the batter’s box is a risk each time, Altmeyer constantly displayed her grit and determination when facing pitchers despite being hit by a pitch seven times this season.</p>\n<p>Another key component to the Gauchos’ lineup was junior infielder Emily Brucelas, playing in all 56 games and ranking second on the team with five homeruns. She registered 50 hits, 13 extra base hits and 26 RBIs this year while scoring 27 runs.</p>\n<p>Also contributing was freshman infielder Melanie Menor with 47 hits on the year, none bigger than the clutch two-out home run she delivered against Fullerton to give the Gauchos the lead and the win on the last day of the season.</p>\n<p>Senior starting pitcher Ashley Ludlow had an outstanding year to close out her collegiate career, oftentimes putting the team on her back when they needed it most. Ludlow managed a stellar ERA of 2.87. She collected 10 wins on the season, pitching 41 games and tallied an impressive 157 strikeouts in 178.1 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Veronika Gulvin also found her place on the team earning eight wins this season while pitching 113.1 innings in 35 games with a 3.52 ERA.  She showed up on the mound in crucial times, striking out 62 hitters. Gulvin was reliable in the pitching rotation, and also provided a dependable go-to arm when senior starter Ashley Ludlow needed relief.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have many things to be proud of this season. For the first time in four years, UCSB swept rival Cal Poly and went 3-0 against UC Davis. As a team, the Gauchos scored 246 runs, had a .370 on base percentage and a .397 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>With most of its roster returning, there is no doubt that this team has a bright future ahead.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71100\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71100\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/season-wrap-up-ucsb-softball-ends-28-28-overall/","id":1183,"author":{"id":293,"name":"Antonia Bird"},"related":[1182,1181,1180],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Back On Road Following Subpar Season Opening Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Softball_vsCalPoly-20160403-DustinHarris-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Following its underwhelming start to the season, the UCSB softball team will be back in action this weekend in hopes of reaching the .500 or above mark as it will face Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific, and Fre...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Looking to improve after a disappointing season opening weekend, the UCSB softball team will face Nebraska-Omaha, Pacific and Stanford in Palo Alto at the Stanford Nike Invitational.</p>\n<p>Action begins on Friday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. when the Gauchos play Nebraska-Omaha.

She leads the team in each of those categories except for runs batted in, where redshirt freshman infielder Vicky Kinney edges her with five.</p>\n<p>Kinney has 10 total bases of her own, accompanied by two home runs and a .714 slugging percentage. Along with senior infielder Nicole Warren (.385/.529/.692), Kinney and Klosterman are catalysts for most of Omaha’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Holding down the mound, the duo of sophomore Laura Roecker and senior Abbie Clanton are the two main pitchers for the Mavs, though each hold earned run averages over five.<br>\nRoecker has thrown in every one of Omaha’s games this season, and opponents have batted .368 against her to this point.</p>\n<p>Clanton is better in that respect, allowing a .260 batting average, but she has yet to notch a win so far this season — something Roecker accomplished on the team’s opening day.</p>\n<p>The Mavericks’ shaky pitching allows the Gauchos a valuable opportunity, one they’ll have to maximize in both games against Omaha Friday as well as at their matchup the following afternoon.</p>\n<p>Capping off UCSB’s doubleheader on Friday will be its matchup against Pacific, whom the Gauchos will play again Saturday. After losing its two opening games, Pacific owns a three-game win streak in which it has allowed only one run.</p>\n<p>The lineup is centered on a pair of senior utility players: Haylee Moran-Rowen and Cassidy Gustafson. Moran-Rowen leads the team with a .467 average, although her inability to draw a walk this season suggests her offensive production will trend downwards from here forward.</p>\n<p>Gustafson leads the team with two home runs and three runs scored; she has also contributed four RBI. She has struck out three times — tied for the squad’s most — and similarly to Moran-Rowen, she has troublingly not been walked in the season’s first five games.</p>\n<p>Most notably, Pacific has a deeper pitching rotation than Omaha and UCSB with sophomore Kenya Lindstrom and freshman Hailey Reed, who have pitched three innings each to provide solid options behind the team’s main arms, junior Marissa Young and Cassidy Gustafson. Young and Gustafson have each thrown double-digit innings in 2017 and will be the main scouting targets for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Lindstrom has been responsible for both of the team’s losses, and her 16.80 ERA is even more eye-popping when compared to the other three pitchers, all of whom have earned run averages below one.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to force Pacific to utilize her this weekend, hoping to make hay as other teams have been able to twice this season.</p>\n<p>Stanford, who opened up its season with six games in Arizona, was racing to a 4-0 record before losing its last two games against San Diego and Fresno State, the latter a 24-8 beat down.</p>\n<p>The Cardinal is led on offense by the scorching play of freshman catcher Teaghan Cowles, who possesses a .520 hitting clip, .556 OBP and .600 slugging percentage.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, senior infielder Kylie Sorenson owns current .400 batting, .448 OBP and .560 slugging averages. The trend of hitting continues with redshirt sophomore utility player Whitney Burks, whose stats are .360 batting, .448 OBP and .680 slugging percentages.</p>\n<p>All have at least 12 total bases and seven runs batted in (Burks leads the bunch with 11 RBI), and Cowles is the only one without a home run, though she does have a slightly rarer triple.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Carolyn Lee is Stanford’s best pitcher, holding a 1.00 ERA and 3-1 record, with two complete games, 10 strikeouts and an opponent batting average of only .228.</p>\n<p>She and freshman Nikki Bauer have combined for over 39 of the team’s 47 innings pitched, and Santa Barbara will likely see at least one of the two on Sunday.</p>\n<p>If the bats come out in full effect at Stanford and the pitchers are able to avoid the early deficits that plagued this team last week, the Gauchos should be able to rebound from their early woes.</p>\n<p>If returning to California brings no reward, however, UCSB will have dug itself into quite a hole to start the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Nebraska-Omaha Friday, Feb. 17, at 2:30 p.m. It will play Pacific later that day at 4:45 p.m. Another contest against Pacific will take place Saturday, Feb. 18, at 10 a.m., while it will face Nebraska-Omaha again at 2:30 p.m. Santa Barbara will end its weekend after its noon bout against Stanford.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/gauchos-back-on-road-following-subpar-season-opening-weekend/","id":1182,"author":{"id":292,"name":"Liam Bailey"},"related":[1181,1180,1179],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
