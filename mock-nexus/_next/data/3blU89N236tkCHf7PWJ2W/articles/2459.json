She later decided to collect the tortillas for on-campus composting.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Recycling (ASR) partnered with her shortly after and supplied designated tortilla bins for her to wheel over to their on-campus composting facility just a couple hundred feet from the stadium.</p>\n<p>According to Sarah Siedschlag, the A.S. environmental programs advisor and former ASR program coordinator, the A.S. Department of Public Worms, formerly a part of ASR, had been composting the tortillas in their worm bins when she came in as coordinator in fall 2012.</p>\n<p>The mass of tortillas proved “too much for the worms,” she said, and so the program opted to have the tortillas industrially composted off-campus in fall 2013.</p>\n<p>Tortilla-flinging began in 1995 during an ESPN-televised basketball game against DePaul University when the student section threw tortillas on the court after the first basket. The tradition was adopted for soccer matches about a decade later.</p>\n<p>The flying tortillas were especially problematic during basketball games; officials whistle any object thrown onto the court as an automatic technical foul for the home team, giving a free throw to the opposing team. Known as the “tortilla technical” in the 1990s, the tradition once cost UCSB three technical fouls in a close game against Pacific University in 1997, prompting former head coach Jerry Pimm to take a microphone and plead that audience members act more like adults.</p>\n<p>To avoid such outcomes, UCSB Athletics does not allow tortilla-throwing at basketball games or soccer games.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB Athletics currently has a “quick response plan” in place whereby field staff retrieve the tortillas almost as soon as they land on the field. The staff then bag the tortillas and leave them on the sidelines for Rankin to collect later.</p>\n<p>Rankin is not allowed on the field during the game, she said, but the exclusive pass granted to her by UCSB Athletics allows her to gather the tortillas in the moments following the game’s conclusion. She said her pass reads that she is the “Director of Phylum Annelida” (Annelida is the phylum to categorize segmented worms, which are used for composting).</p>\n<p>Rankin said she has found students to be quite “inventive” as to how far across the field they can fling tortillas. Frozen tortillas typically go further because of their rigidness, she said, as do thick tortillas and baked tortillas.</p>\n<p>Tortilla-throwing is “a good release” for students, Rankin said, but she doesn’t want to encourage it.</p>\n<p>“I just try to get a better solution to what could have been wasted,” Rankin said.</p>\n<p>In her years collecting tortillas, Rankin said she has hardly received thanks for what she does. This is fine, she said, because her work is completely voluntary, and she aims to keep a low profile.</p>\n<p>“At least I make millions happy, which just so happen to be worms,” she said.</p><div

He says that students are more likely to trust emails from these “legitimate” accounts. <em>Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The email, sent by Sam Horowitz, the chief information security officer at UCSB, gave tips for keeping student information secure, such as how to spot phishing attempts, suspicious URLs and Trojan horse attachments.</p>\n<p>Horowitz said this latest phishing campaign was made possible by “a few relatively narrow campaigns targeted at staff” in the summer. The attack originated when a compromised U-Mail account sought to collect additional usernames and passwords in the last week of September.</p>\n<p>According to Horowitz, users are more likely to trust the compromised account when it is a real UCSB email account. The result is “a continuous loop:” one account gets phished and that account is used to phish others.</p>\n<p>As a result, it becomes difficult to track or prevent phishing attacks when they are actually sourced from legitimate accounts.</p>\n<p>At that point, students would have to call or visit the Collaborate Student Support Center to have a necessary password reset on their account. According to Horowitz, there’s no way to tell how many people responded to the attacks, but he can confirm that it was “more than a rare occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the message came too late for Ashley de Leon, a first-year film and media studies major, whose account was locked when it became a victim to phishing.</p>\n<p>De Leon explains that she received a high number of illicit emails informing her that her inbox was too full and that she needed to sign in to upgrade her storage. At first, she responded by clearing out her inbox, but after repeated pestering, she finally submitted her information.</p>\n<p>“I first noticed something was wrong when the window disappeared after I put in my information,” she said. “Then things started getting really wrong about a day later when I was receiving emails from Microsoft saying that my emails weren’t sending. I hadn’t sent any emails, and it was like 50 of these coming in.”</p>\n<p>The U-Mail system was blocking a large number of the outgoing emails that the phishers were using her account to send, but it’s still unknown how many were actually successfully sent.</p>\n<p>“First I changed my password … and it worked, but then the next day I got entirely locked out of the whole system,” de Leon said.</p>\n<p>After receiving help from the I.T. department, de Leon was finally able to recover her account, and it is no longer being used for phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>NCSAM “emphasizes proper cyber security practices through webinars, posters, YouTube videos, social media outreach and on-campus presentations,” Matt Hall, the chief information officer at UCSB, said. Fittingly, the first two weeks of NCSAM focus directly on topics of phishing — email and otherwise.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Oct. 13, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73142\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73142\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/u-mail-phishing-scams-resurface/","id":2458,"author":{"id":106,"name":"Josh Bevan"},"related":[2457,2456,2455],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Arbor’s Tarot Card Reader Buckingham Reads Fortunes, Gives Advice","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-13-at-9.45.35-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-13-at-9.45.35-PM.png?resize=586%2C374&ssl=1","description":"Near the corner of the Arbor’s bustling walkway, a small camp-like setup can be seen next to Larry Calvaletto’s “Got Questions?” booth.

Advertised with a piece of cardboard inked with the words “Tarot Reading,” the curious setup is gathered around a man in dark clothing reading a student’s fortune.</p>\n<p>Dan Buckingham, a 26-year-old Tarot card reader from Michigan, has settled down on campus after three years of travelling. He has been visiting the Arbor Monday through Fridays the past five weeks.</p>\n<p>According to Buckingham, his primary goal is not to make money; he charges no “fixed rate” and asks only for donations if students are willing. Rather, he said he does Tarot reading to offer guidance to lost students.</p>\n<p>“I do it to help people; to give guidance and counsel to those who are just sort of wanting some clarity or wanting advice from somebody,” he said. “And past that, it’s a way to bring up certain topics or uncomfortable discussions that are otherwise inaccessible other than through a medium like Tarot or something like that.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham has been doing Tarot readings for almost a year-and-a-half, receiving generally positive feedback from his clients.</p>\n<p>“Before the reading, they’re normally curious,” Buckingham said. “The majority of them have never done this before, so they generally go to it with some expectation but don’t really know what’s going to happen. Afterwards, they’re generally pleased, surprised at the accuracy and overall happy with the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The basic idea behind a Tarot reading is simple — the querent (the one receiving the fortune) picks an instructed amount of cards from a shuffled 78-card deck. The reader then lays out the chosen cards in a spread — that is a shape or pattern — that consists of different meanings depending on where the card is placed.</p>\n<p>The Tarot reader (Buckingham, in this case) then interprets how the meaning of the card corresponds to the position it is in, and he gives a description or advice to the client what the spread seems to be saying about their current life situation.</p>\n<p>Although Buckingham’s primary goal is to help those who are lost, there are some people he does not read for.</p>\n<p>“I almost never read for people who are intoxicated,” Buckingham said. “Also, if I have a suspicion that somebody won’t be appreciative or won’t take it seriously, then I will immediately turn them away because I don’t want to waste my energy and time to help somebody who is not going to use it.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham’s biggest concern involves contemporary society, and the direction it is headed if it doesn’t change.</p>\n<p>“I sort of see that the way humans conduct themselves — with themselves as well as the rest of the world — is in a manner that is unsustainable and cannot be maintained for any much longer. And so this includes a whole host of systems we have in place and the ways we do business,” Buckingham said. “If this is not somehow overturned or stopped or changed, then very serious irreversible repercussions will result, and so that’s of concern to me.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham specifically chose to do his readings on a university campus because students are “kind of figuring out who they are,” during a very important “transformation” in their lives.</p>\n<p>“So I really feel like the world is in a position where that age group and that kind of potential is really necessary to address, and they really are the ticket to the solution.”</p>\n<p>Buckingham’s biggest advice to UCSB students is to not worry too much, including about knowledge, material wealth, a degree or a job.</p>\n<p>“I think in one way everyone is already enlightened, or is in complete connection with everything and that there is no religion or doctrine or thing that one needs to pursue or experience to get that,” he said. “In the end, I just want to empower them; urge them to think about things.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

id=\"caption-attachment-73212\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of NYU Tandon School of Engineering</em></p></div>\n<p>A group of hackers from UC Santa Barbara is one of the top teams to advance in a cyber security contest that began with 18,000 undergraduate students from around the world.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering hosted a 48-hour cyber security contest on Sept. 16 known as Capture The Flag (CTF), and UCSB’s team, Shellphish, came out in the top ten of all United States teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is comprised of Andrew Dutcher, Caitlin Scarberry and Brandon Dutcher. Originally a brainchild of UCSB Hacking Team, Shellphish was founded by UCSB professor Giovanni Vigna and is one of the oldest continually active CTF teams in existence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve always been super into computers and started programming them around the age of 12 just making games and stuff,” Andrew Dutcher said of his start in hacking. Andrew Dutcher and his friends attended a hacking competition at Carnegie Mellon University during their junior year of high school, and he said, “we ended up winning, somehow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan Shoshitaishvili, a senior member of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shellphish and a computer science graduate student, had similar beginnings in hacking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been working with computers since I was eight, but got pulled into actual hacking in high school by hacking around with my friends,” he said. “I went to the DEFCON computer security conference held in Las Vegas every summer and was completely hooked after that.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In CTF, students perform numerous challenges to test their cyber security skills. Easier challenges can take as little as 10 minutes, while more difficult tasks can take up to 18 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CTF events occur all over the world every weekend, but Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) is the largest student-run cyber security event in the nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSAW features six competitions, keynote presentations, workshops and an industry fair. Students range across all different ages and experience levels from high school students to doctoral candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the seemingly daunting task of 48 hours of competition to solve intense cyber security challenges, the common sentiment among both organizers and participants of CSAW is that it’s a fun event for people interested in cyber security.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“CTF is really just a puzzle game for security professionals to practice their skills in a controlled and fun environment,” Andrew Dutcher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To expand the reach of the competition to gain worldwide impact, CSAW this year partnered with NYU Abu Dhabi and the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasir Memon, professor of computer science and engineering at NYU, founded the competition 13 years ago when cyber security was still a burgeoning field of work. He said that, today, young minds are needed to address the vulnerabilities in rapidly expanding technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think security is an interesting discipline, because it’s more than just technology,” Memon said. “It’s a psychological problem, a business problem, a policy problem, a legal problem. We need to have the right minds in the discipline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, there have been over one million cybersecurity job openings just this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While expansion of these skills may be key to finding work in the increasingly competitive job market, for the members of Shellphish, it’s just a fun way to hang out with friends while learning about hacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Thompson, third-year computer science major at NYU with a specialty in cyber security, is the lead organizer for the Capture The Flag event. He said it is “extremely important” for people to know that cyber security programs such as CSAW are making an effort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Going through this competition is the equivalent to earning a degree in computer security; having the CSAW name behind a person gives them a lot of validity,” Thompson said. “We’re trying to get companies to realize the talent that’s available while also giving people something to challenge themselves and have fun with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 15 teams which have outlasted preliminary competitions will advance to finals in New York from Nov. 10-12. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about Shellphish’s shot at winning CTF finals, Andrew Dutcher said they were “almost zero” due to the graduation of much of the original team. He said, however, that “regardless of if we win or not, the next step is to keep improving … There’s always room to grow and get better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memon, too, is remaining optimistic about UCSB’s chances. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think [UCSB] will do well,” he said. “You have a good team; you’ll place high.”</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: Shellphish placed in the top ten of United States teams, but did not receive first place. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73189\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73189\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/","id":2457,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2456,2455,2454],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
