Morse argued against same-sex marriage by outlining values of heterosexual unions. Prior to the talk, members of the queer community chanted inside the lecture hall to protest the ideas to be presented by Morse.</p>\n<p>According to Morse, non-traditional marriage negatively affects how children connect to parents.</p>\n<p>“The marriage debate is really about children; all the other issues you hear about can be handled some other way than re-defining marriage,” Morse said. “If we’re going to re-define marriage, we’re somehow re-defining the institution that attaches one generation to another.”</p>\n<p>Morse said forms of “third-party reproduction” like surrogacy are “structural injustices,” because they separate children from their biological parents.</p>\n<p>“Kids need and deserve their own parents and same-sex marriage will enshrine into law the opposite. Same-sex marriage will require the law to say that it’s a myth that kids need their own mothers and fathers,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Anscombe Society president and third-year philosophy major Carlos Flores said the debate on same-sex marriage often lacks important arguments favoring heterosexual unions.</p>\n<p>“In particular, many who support same-sex marriage seem to have never heard the case for why same-sex marriage ought to not be accepted,” Flores said. “They have accepted straw men which they easily knock down.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, same-sex marriage “victimizes” people in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>“I get that we’re going to have genderless marriage soon, but I just want to say there are going to unanticipated consequences,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Flores said while the talk revealed “worthwhile reasons” to oppose same-sex marriage, he doubts those in favor will change their mind.</p>\n<p>“Because people have very strong feelings on the topic of same-sex marriage, often due to personal struggles,” Flores said. “I think it is unrealistic to expect anyone firmly in support of same-sex marriage to change their mind.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and feminist studies double major Kevin Tang participated in the protest and said Morse’s argument ignores the importance of love in a family unit.</p>\n<p>“She cares so much about traditional family structures that I feel she leaves out the most important aspect of a true family, which is love and support, and I believe that our community is a family that provides exactly what her talk lacked,” Tang said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year earth science major Julian Consoli said he opposes same-sex marriage for religious reasons but did not feel Morse presented well-constructed arguments.</p>\n<p>“I think the basis for her arguments are in religion, in God — which I actually agree with — but I don’t think she was really able to present those really clearly. I was a little disappointed,” Consoli said.</p>\n<p>Consoli also said it is important for “liberal schools” that largely support gay marriage to consider other views.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we should hear other people’s opinions, so I think that’s very important so I did appreciate that. Instead of always butting heads, we should be able to come together and discuss these things,” Consoli said. “I think it’s civil of us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated A.S. Queer Commission protested outside the lecture hall where the event took place. Some of the students involved in the protest were members of the queer community, however were not protesting in affiliation with the commission. In addition, the protestors were not escorted out of the event by Community Service Officers (CSOs), but left on their own accord.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Last year’s Paddle Out was hugely successful in helping many to find solace on the water and to recognize the hope and strength that comes from community. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Hundreds of UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents attended the second annual I.V. Memorial Paddle Out Wednesday evening at the beach north of Campus Point to commemorate the lives of the six students lost in the tragedy of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>UCSB Surf Team hosted the event with help from lifeguards and safety personnel who led attendees with boards and floatation devices into high tide. Onlookers who did not enter the water watched from the beach and surrounding cliffs as participants in the ocean formed a circle to symbolize solidarity, similar to the one formed a year ago.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the Paddle Out represents healing and is the “perfect ending” to the series of memorial events paying homage to the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“In my humble opinion, doing it in the ocean is, in itself, a healing and a cleansing act,” Jones said. “I think many community members that participated this evening intrinsically recognized the event.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year philosophy major and UCSB Surf Team member Alex Banks said the event was unique way to pay condolences to the students lost last year due to I.V.’s close proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“We have this beautiful ocean, and paddling out and surfing is a great way to pay respect to people that have passed away, regardless of the circumstances,” Banks said. “The fact that we have this resource is cool, and I think it’s a very inviting and serene atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Anne Trinh said she was not present during the events of May 23 last year, but still felt the Paddle Out strengthened the sense of community.</p>\n<p>“Being able to come out makes everyone feel like they are part of the community,” Trinh said. “So taking part in remembering those we lost, and recognizing what happened really allows us to come together, no matter how long you’ve been here.”</p>\n<p>Jones said the Paddle Out took on a “jubilant” atmosphere when people on the shore cheered for a couple’s pitbull wearing a life jacket struggling to stay on the surfboard while the couple tried to Paddle Out.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63894\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63894\" data-attachment-id=\"63894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/paddle-out-2015_by-lorenzo-basilio-web-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1125&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1125\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432751953\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Paddle Out/Sunset 2015\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63894\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was after everyone had started paddling out and they were trying to catch up,” Jones said. “But the waves started to kick up and they just couldn’t get the dog out there on the board. A wave would come over and knock him off the board and people would be like, ‘Oh no, oh no,’ and it was that kind of fun community vibe.”</p>\n<p>According to Banks, the presence of lifeguards, water patrol and emergency responders contributed to the sense of community for those participating in the event, because it showed solidarity between the county and local residents.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we got all these different agencies like the fire department and police to come out and watch over this event just promotes what we’re trying to do here even more,” Banks said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and Humans of UCSB Photographer Alex Nguyen said the event felt more optimistic and celebratory compared to last year’s Paddle Out, which focused on the community’s strength dealing with tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Last year’s Paddle Out was a reflection of what it means to be a Gaucho in the wake of a tragedy,” Nguyen said. “This year’s is more of a celebration of knowing what it means to be a Gaucho and the strength this community has gained over the last year.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the Paddle Out is symbolic of UCSB’s dedication to serving the environment and overcoming difficulties in light of the recent oil spill near Refugio.</p>\n<p>“There was discussion about whether or not it would affect the Paddle Out, which was planned months ago,” Jones said. “I think there’s also a consciousness about our environment, about the beauty of environment, about protecting our environment that is symbolized in the Paddle Out itself.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 28, 2015 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/","id":2731,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2730,2729,2728],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One Year Later: Candlelit Vigil and March Remembers Students Lost","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Storke Tower rang out six times Saturday evening to begin a moment of silence as part of the Candlelit Vigil and March held to commemorate the students lost in the events of May 23 last year.

Yang said UCSB will continue to honor the lives lost on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“Tragedy will not tear us apart but bring us closer together,” Yang said. “We will never forget the loss we suffered a year ago, but we remember not just with sadness, but with fondness.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has established six unique memorial scholarships in honor of each of the victims, according to Yang.</p>\n<p>“We can make their lives more meaningful by the way we choose to live our own, and we can make the lives of others more meaningful in the ways we choose to honor them,” Yang said. “We will uphold their memory now and in years to come with six individual memorial scholarships … individualized to reflect their character and their passions.”</p>\n<p>Academic Senate chair and sociology professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani read a letter on behalf of the Hong family which stated the need for a cultural shift away from violence.</p>\n<p>“James believed in a world without evil, a world where tragic instances like this would never occur. We hope it will become a reality,” the Hong family stated in the letter. “Parenting and mental well-being should be focused on more in family, school and society. We should put more emphasis on moral values and teach kids to see the good in others and respect others.”</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez, father of Chris Martinez, said those affected by the tragedy should continue to live their lives as a testament to those lost.</p>\n<p>“For our absent brothers, daughters, sisters and friends, for their sake we must also live,” Martinez said. “We can mourn for those we lost, and we can go on living. There is no contradiction in this. We must remember that making something of this life is not an affront to the dead.”</p>\n<p>Alan Martinez, uncle of Chris Martinez, said he continues to mourn as memories of the tragedy resurface.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a little afraid of being in a world where people expect me to be over it after a year,” Martinez said. “Every time I forget it, if it’s for a few minutes or a few hours, remembering it again is like going through it again. Every time you forget about it and remember it you have to accept it again.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63764\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1244942648\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63790\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63764\" data-attachment-id=\"63764\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-24/one-year-later-students-remembered-in-candlelit-vigil-and-march/2015-vigil_lorenzo-basilio-21/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432413353\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2015 Vigil_Lorenzo Basilio-21\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63764\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isla Vista residents created a memorial in front of IV Deli Mart in remembrance of Chris Martinez. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Kelly Wang, mother of George Chen, said she hopes to see social and political changes prevent future shootings.</p>\n<p>“I pray there will be an end of the senseless killing of innocents,” Wang said. “Murderers must be punished with no excuse, no exception, and no reservation.

I did everything that I could to make their passing from this life to the next, as comfortable and as painless as possible,” Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>Sullivan also said having experienced the May 23 shooting, he believes individuals should work to improve gun safety.</p>\n<p>“I witnessed firsthand the violence that guns can cause,” Sullivan said. “This will continue until we speak up and change things. I want my children to be able to walk around with peace of mind, knowing they will not be shot down in the street.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63786\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-43.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1440456052\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63790\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63786\" data-attachment-id=\"63786\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-24/one-year-later-students-remembered-in-candlelit-vigil-and-march/2015-vigil_lorenzo-basilio-43/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-43.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432411648\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2015 Vigil_Lorenzo Basilio-43\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-43.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-43.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63786 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-43.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-43.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-43.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63786\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students and I.V. residents participate in a memorial walk from Storke Plaza to People’s Park, passing through Pardall Tunnel<em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-63708\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">USC professor Kristen Zaleska spoke Thursday about the prevalence of sexual assault within the armed forces, and the similarities and differences between sexual assault in the military and on university campuses.<em> Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education office hosted a lecture on military sexual trauma (MST) by assistant professor at the USC School of Social Work Kristen Zalesky in the Flying A room Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>Zalesky’s talk highlighted the prevalence of sexual assault in the military and drew parallels between the experiences of civilian sexual assault survivors and sexual assault survivors serving in the military. Zalesky detailed the incidence of MST compared to civilians and discussed stark similarities and contrasts between sexual assault in the military and in civilian life. About a dozen students, primarily interns in the CARE advocacy office, attended the lecture.</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, there is a parallel between sexual assault at universities and within the military. According to Zaleski, one in two women and one in 12 men experience MST in the course of their service.</p>\n<p>“When you are in a Greek system or university system you have your own reporting process,” Zalesky said. “You have your own police department you have your own way of tracking sexual trauma and you have a culture in which you are kind of confined, and when we’re talking about the military, we’re talking about that in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky said the military and UC face similar difficulties in addressing sexual assault, and neither are particularly effective.</p>\n<p>“[UC system’s framework] rarely results in a conviction of the assailant and it’s also true for the military,” Zalesky said. “This university culture, it’s not that different from someone who is 18 and chooses military service, in terms of the sexual boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the common ideas surrounding how sexual assault occurs usually do not match reality.</p>\n<p>“These are the typical assumptions we make about sexual assault: it’s a random guy in a dark alley; it’s someone we don’t know; they have a weapon,” Zalesky said. “Most often, people who are raped are raped by somebody they have a trusting relationship with — it’s a family member, it’s a boyfriend, it’s an ex-boyfriend, it’s a best friend.”</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, this difference between the idea of a typical perpetrators and the reality of who they usually are makes reporting more difficult.</p>\n<p>“That’s why when you look at rape reports it’s so hard to get somebody to report because it wasn’t so clear. He wasn’t wearing a mask in a dark alley as a stranger with a knife right? It was your best friend who you’ve partied with for a year and a half,” Zalesky said. “The reason that we hesitate to report sexual assaults is because we’re so confused because it doesn’t match up with the construct of what we imagined.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said those in the armed forces who report are typically required to stay in service, as leave for survivors is not granted most of the time, which makes avoiding assailants virtually impossible. For this and other reasons, sexual assault survivors in the military have fewer options than their civilian counterparts, Zalesky said.</p>\n<p>“From day one this is your brother, this is your sister right? We are a military family,” Zalesky said. “Even if you want to take time off, even if you want to go see your mom, you can’t because you signed this [enlistment] contract.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the number of male survivors of MST are roughly equal to the number of female survivors — just over 300,000 survivors of both genders — but males are far less likely to report than females.</p>\n<p>“Men are being brutalized as often during military service, but women come forward and it’s more socially acceptable to be a woman that’s been raped than a man that’s been raped … we have an epidemic of men who aren’t talking about their sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky closed with a brief discussion on advocacy and how to help survivors, followed by a question and answer session with the audience. Zalesky said a more effective strategy for combating MST is not necessarily to encourage women to “not get raped” but rather encourage a culture of bystander intervention.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and feminist studies double major Clair Breen said student engagement in issues related to MST is important for continuing advocacy on the problem.</p>\n<p>“I think anything we can do is awesome, especially as college students,” Breen said. “Advocacy work is hard though because it’s hard to see a difference.”</p>\n<p>Breen also said her main take-away from the presentation was related to the difficulties MST survivors face in addressing their assaults.</p>\n<p>“I took away that it’s very hard to report in the military — that it’s a really prevalent issue,” Breen said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/","id":2732,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2731,2730,2729],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
