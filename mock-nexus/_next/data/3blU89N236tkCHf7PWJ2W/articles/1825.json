Yang announced the transition in an email to the student body on Monday afternoon, writing that the decision was made in consultation with students, staff and faculty and with the agreement of the Academic Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Summer Sessions staff previously told students in a campus-wide email on April 4 that a final decision regarding Summer Session A, which is scheduled to begin on June 22 and end on August 1, would be announced by April 17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university has not made a decision on how it will conduct Summer Session B, which is scheduled to begin on August 3 and end on September 12, and concurrent sessions F and G, but said in the FAQ that a decision would be made by June 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said in his email that it was likely that the later sessions would also be moved to remote instruction “if the State and County orders promoting physical distancing have not been revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the FAQ website, the university noted that specific lab and studio courses do not have remote alternatives, and that “it is critical that students who need these courses be given the opportunity to continue making degree progress in Summer if at all possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Session B is also when we host our transition programs for incoming freshmen and transfer students, which have a strong community-building component that can best be delivered in person,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given the volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the many unknowns, we would like to give the situation sufficient time to develop so that if there is any chance of safely hosting Session B in person, we can do so.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the university does switch to remote instruction for Session B, when programs such as the Freshman Summer Start Program and Transfer Edge are typically held, UCSB is “preparing to transition the programs to the virtual space.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are committed to providing a strong academic experience, access to helpful workshops and resources, and social and community-building activities for our incoming students,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courses for Session A and concurrent sessions C, D and E will be held during their scheduled time slots, according to the FAQ. Currently, the university is moving forward as if all courses in Session B, F and G will be held in-person, but is preparing to switch to remote instruction if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some summer courses are traditionally held online each summer, but with the transition to fully remote instruction, courses designed to be taught in-person will now have to be adjusted to online as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the FAQ, the university emphasized differences between online classes and remote instruction, describing online courses as ones that “have been specifically vetted, approved, and optimized for online learning,” while remote instruction is being used to describe classes that “were designed for in-person instruction, and are being adapted for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the transition to remote instruction for Session A, the university will not be offering campus housing to new students in June and July, according to the FAQ, but students currently living in campus housing will be allowed to stay during the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FAQ also pointed students toward residences in Isla Vista, where hundreds of students are currently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subleasing their rooms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after moving home for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Session B, Housing &amp; Residential Services is planning on offering its usual services, but is waiting on a final decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who sign up for summer housing will be able to cancel their contracts with no penalty if the university switches to remote instruction for Session B, according to the FAQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will still be virtually putting on its three pre-college programs, the Research Mentorship Program, the Summer Research Academies and the Summer Scholars Program, for high school students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The fund, provided by students through campus fees, will have $88,688.30 left after the transfer to the Financial Crisis Response Team (FCRT) and Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) offices, according to the resolution. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was really important that we use some of our excess student fees that the students have paid into A.S. in the first place,” Ferguson said. “This is their money and it deserves to be going towards things that will be helping them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCRT, which helps students facing financial difficulties through a variety of services such as housing rent vouchers, will disperse the money among students who need it most based on the response team’s general review process, according to Rebecca Plotkin, the basic needs coordinator in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and a member of the FCRT.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EOP provides </span><a href=\"http://eop.sa.ucsb.edu/services/grant\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S./EOP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grants to students facing specific financial needs, such as medical costs, according to Aaron Jones, director of the EOP; he added that the EOP office currently has roughly $4,000 left for A.S./EOP grants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the organizations to receive the money, Ferguson said he expects A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez, who is directed by the resolution to transfer the funds, to do so “promptly.” After the FCRT and EOP distribute the funds, Marquez will write a report about how the money was spent and present it to the A.S. Senate, according to Ferguson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the unallocated funds would be used to fund student groups or various projects. The bill’s second author, Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, said that because of the remote nature of spring quarter, the money would be best spent helping students who are reeling from the financial impact of the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of financial insecurity that people are facing, especially with a lot of them losing their jobs, losing out on income that they were expecting,” Segura said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the remaining money in the budget is for “emergency situations or just things … we don’t foresee that we can’t really plan ahead for.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/a-s-senate-allocates-80000-to-student-relief-groups-to-support-those-affected-by-coronavirus/","id":1824,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1823,1822,1821],"comments":[{"id":"8ea7d3f8-89e6-49e9-9602-7e32ad6a0035","name":"Sample User 1","email":"nicholasjbarak@gmail.com","parent":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

So far, no one has broken any rules; they’re taking it seriously.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said that he aimed to have the server as precise as possible, having users follow a 1-meter-per-block scale and directing them to use Google Earth for measurements. Members of the Discord server have been sending pictures of buildings for references as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first completed structure was UCSB’s signature Storke Tower, soon followed by Storke Plaza, the UCen and the Arbor, said Neumann; the University Library is also in progress. Once campus construction is finished, the project will expand to rebuilding Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said his overall goal is to build the campus to such an accurate degree that when someone explores the completed server, it feels like the real deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Neumann, the server has been experiencing technical issues due to heavy traffic on the hosting site. With this being his first time running a large server, Neumann has been doing his best to keep members updated on the server’s status, actively posting announcements on the Discord and Facebook groups. Once the technical issues are resolved, Neumann hopes to incorporate a survival portion to the world, which includes player-versus-player elements, and hold weekend events within the server. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the quarter, Neumann said he is looking forward to celebrating a Minecraft graduation with everyone in the community. But for now, the main focus has been constructing the campus in creative mode, a feature that allows users to build freely with access to all the materials within the game, in addition to just spending time indoors and following the state’s stay-at-home order. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93901\" style=\"width: 1093px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93901\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93901\" data-attachment-id=\"93901\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=1083%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1083,609\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-93901 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?w=1083&amp;ssl=1 1083w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Charles Neumann</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Montero, a third-year physics major and active member in the community, is responsible for starting the construction of the University Library and many other structures in the server.

However, all appointments have been transferred to virtual Zoom meetings, and 24-hour crisis hotlines remain active. In addition, the C.A.P.S. Mental Health Peer Program is “working on creating virtual Spring 2020 content” to give students an opportunity to connect with peers, according to its </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu\">website</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the RCSGD assured students that it would continue to provide them with resources to “support [students] during these trying times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We assure you that we will still have events and there will be ways to engage with the center and your LGBTQIA+ peers,” a representative from the RCSGD </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RCSGD.UCSB/posts/2592587471012681?__tn__=K-R\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said in a Facebook post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The post assured students that the RCSGD would be continuing to create spaces for LGBTQIA+ students, as well as linking basic needs resources from other departments.

It’s hard to see the social media posts, and I want to reply even if it isn’t to me, so if you have a concern, please reach out to me and I would be more than happy to talk about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the UCSB community, Ashlock offered a word of advice to those hesitant to use the new online services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seven billion of us are all facing things that we haven’t before.
