class=\"wp-caption-text\">“No es fácil andar en la calle [It’s not easy being on the streets],” says Hijinio Camacho.<em> Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Since the first week of classes, however, the university has prohibited Camacho and other off-campus vendors from selling on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life (OSL), the vendors’ sales violate the Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding food vendors unaffiliated with the university. OSL is only allowed to grant permits to campus organizations, not the companies and vendors who work with them.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, off-campus vendors have been allowed to sell products alongside student organizations with permits granted by OSL.</p>\n<p>According to Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, the office wasn’t fully aware the vendors were violating university policies until a meeting on Sept. 25 with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada.”</p>\n<p>— Hijinio Camacho</p></blockquote>\n<p>Camacho said he was notified about the policy reinforcements two days before school started. He then met with OSL on the first day of school to understand why he was no longer permitted to work with student organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>His first event of the school year was a fundraiser with the UCSB Promise Scholars.</p>\n<p>Camacho had planned events with Seoul’d Out, Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), <em>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion, y Revolucion</em>, (M.U.J.E.R.) and the Latino Business Association. He started working with student organizations about two years ago and has held fundraisers with groups such as <em>Hermanas Unidas</em>, <em>Raices de Mi Tierra</em>, Alpha Phi Omega and Lambda Theta Alpha.</p>\n<p>Every school day of this year was booked for an event, Camacho said. Student organizations would typically keep 15 percent of the profit from the shared fundraisers.</p>\n<p>OSL, UCSB Concessions and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety are currently creating “more inclusive policies” that will lift the current restrictions surrounding off-campus vendors and allow vendors like Camacho to continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p>“We really want to figure out how to add [off-campus vendor permits] to the sorts of permits we are able to approve…both because it’s a good fundraising mechanism for them but also it has been a positive contribution to our campus,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Tuesday and told the <em>Nexus</em> he now needs two more permits from the university to work with student organizations. The two permits will allow him to sell on campus either once a week or once a month.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said the sudden policy revision further contributed to the frustration and confusion felt by both the students and the vendors because some vendors, like Camacho, already had events planned with student groups.</p>\n<p>“I have been been really clear with every conversation with my colleagues on how important it is that we figure this out, that we figure it out quickly, but also give good and clear advice,” Ashlock said. “That’s why it’s taking a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Camacho, who hails from Puebla, Mexico, has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. He spent time in I.V. during the early years of his time in the U.S. but found little success due to the demographic at the time.</p>\n<p>“When I arrived [in I.V.]… two years after arriving to this country, at that time there was mainly Asians and white people. It was 10 percent Latino,” Camacho said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79154\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"764019501\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79193\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79154\" data-attachment-id=\"79154\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/img_1111/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elote Hijinio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79154 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camacho has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. <em>Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Upon his return to Isla Vista two years ago, however, Camacho noticed more students of Latino descent at UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB was categorized as a Hispanic Serving Institute by the Association of Colleges and Universities in 2015 and has a 28 percent Chicano/Latino population, according to the 2016-2017 campus profile published by the Office of Budget and Planning.</p>\n<p>The rise in street food popularity over the years has opened the gates to members outside of the Latino community to indulge in Mexican snacks found on push-carts like Camacho’s.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been looking for you for two years!” exclaimed Jacqueline Liu, a third-year global studies and psychology double major, as she approached Camacho’s cart last week. Liu said she remembers living in a Mexican community as a child and taking money from her mother’s purse so she and her brother could buy snacks from their local elotero.</p>\n<p>With a large and increasing fan club comes busy schedules, as Camacho’s days often begin at 3 a.m. when he needs to pick up merchandise, ending at sundown when his day of selling is over.</p>\n<p>On other days, he arrives in I.V. at around 3 p.m. and begins his route on Picasso Road at Children’s Park, making his way down Embarcadero del Norte and down Pardall Road, with a stop in front of Freebirds along the way. From there he goes to Abrego Road and circles back onto Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Camacho also created a Venmo account two years ago that allowed customers to buy from him without using cash. He has also made a Snapchat account with a Bitmoji character so customers can now locate him when he is in I.V. His username is “hijiniocamacho1.”</p>\n<p>Camacho has also sold food in Los Angeles, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Sacramento and Lompoc.</p>\n<p>In these cities, Camacho has been stopped by the police and forced to surrender his money and merchandise, as well as been robbed by local gangs. He said street vendors like himself encounter these obstacles on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Recent news coverage of street vendors has made their struggles visible to the public, but it only shows a small amount of what really goes on, Camacho said.</p>\n<p>The working conditions in the other cities pulled Camacho back to I.V. but he said even here he has faced issues with a local police officer.</p>\n<p>“<em>No es fácil andar en la calle</em> [It’s not easy being on the streets],” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Despite the recent pause in selling on campus, Camacho said he hopes to stay in I.V. and continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p><em>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada,” </em>Camacho said.<em> “Ellos te tratan tal y como eres porque ellos si se están preparando.”</em></p>\n<p>“Now that I’ve arrived for a second time, I’m thinking of staying here because here is where I have seen that the students treat you just like you are and don’t judge you because you’re not an educated person, because you’re not a civilized person,” Camacho said. “They treat you just as you are because they are preparing themselves [for their futures].”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/","id":2343,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2342,2341,2340],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Geographer Receives Plous Award","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Assistant professor of geography Krzysztof Janowicz was recently awarded the 2014-2015 Harold J.

Plous Award by the College of Letters and Sciences for his outstanding performance as a junior faculty member.</p>\n<p>The Plous Award is one of the university’s oldest and most prestigious honors, established in 1957 in honor of assistant professor of economics Harold J. Plous who died at 32 years old after only three years in the position. The award is given to new and junior faculty members early in their careers with the university.</p>\n<p>Janowicz, who received recognition for his research in the geographic information science and “geoinformatics” fields, is scheduled to give the annual Harold J. Plous lecture next Spring as part of his appointment.</p>\n<p>Dean of Science and professor of physics Pierre Wiltzius said he believes Janowicz has been an impressive junior scholar from the start of his career at the university several years ago.</p>\n<p>“He has been with us now maybe for something like two years, and I was actually part of helping recruit him with the geography department,” Wiltzius said.</p>\n<p>“Among a very strong competitive pool of candidates he was the strongest already, so we were very lucky to be able to attract him in a very important area of geography.”</p>\n<p>According to geography professor Dar Roberts, Janowicz’s work in mobile computing and GPS based location services is especially relevant today.</p>\n<p>“The growing way we use smart phones, tablets or other devices to navigate our cars, find good restaurants, stores that sell specialized items, or simply look for things in geographic space,” Roberts said. “You can easily imagine that research that makes this easier and more accurate is of high interest.”</p>\n<p>Professor and chair of geography Dan Montello said the Plous Award demonstrates more than creative work and research.</p>\n<p>“I would emphasize that this is not only about being a talented junior professor, but it’s about already getting involved in campus life,” Montello said. “And that means intellectual activity both within your department and outside your department, I think those are important criteria.”</p>\n<p>According to Montello, starting this year Janowicz will chair the Cognitive Science Program, a position usually filled by a tenured professor instead of a junior professor, which is not a tenured position. The program gives graduate students the option of adding a Ph.D. emphasis in cognitive science.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius said the department is honored to have such a distinguished colleague as Janowicz.</p>\n<p>“We’re very proud that one of the members of the science division won this very prestigious prize. I couldn’t be happier for Janowicz and also for the Department of Geography, which is a highly ranked department,” Wiltzius said. “It’s one of the highest ranking geography departments of the country.”</p>\n<p>According to Wiltzius, Janowicz’s studies center around Geographic Information Science.</p>\n<p>“[GIS] is how we deal with all the information that relates one way or another to geography,” Wiltzius said. “The big data bases, all the information that comes from sensors whether they are terrestrial, satellite or airplane based. It’s a rapidly growing area that’s a little bit between geography and computer science, so it’s really a very exciting area that our geography department wants to be in.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/geographer-receives-plous-award/","id":2342,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2341,2340,2339],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
