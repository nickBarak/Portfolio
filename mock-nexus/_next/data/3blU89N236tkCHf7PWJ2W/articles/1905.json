What the fourth-year UC Santa Barbara club baseball team captain lacks in terms of size and stature, he makes up with tremendous speed on the basepaths and lightning-quick bat speed. Think of a Dustin Pedroia or a Jose Altuve type. Rosenblum loves the game of baseball and plays with an immeasurable amount of hustle and heart. Not only does he play the game each time as if it is his last, Rosenblum is a true student of the game. After playing second base his first three years at UCSB, this offseason Rosenblum elected to make the transition to third base to open up a spot at second. To learn the nuances of playing third base he sought advice from UCSB division one infielder Jeremiah Muno.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76654\" style=\"width: 576px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76654\" data-attachment-id=\"76654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-carries-5-game-win-streak-into-road-slate/img_0695-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0695\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76654\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=566%2C425\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_0695.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76654\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UCSB club baseball’s core group of seniors out at the wood bat tournament in Mesquite, Nevada. <em>Photo courtesy of Max Fernbacher</em></p></div>\n<p>Rosenblum is just one of the reasons UCSB club baseball is off to a hot 7-1 start this season. The other contributions have come from the twenty-nine other players on the roster, all of whom are UCSB students. Four junior college transfers bolster the pitching staff and eight seniors provide leadership on the team. According to Rosenblum the team is composed of former high school and junior college baseball players that simply want to continue playing the sport they love.</p>\n<p>“Our team is made up of guys who want to continue their playing careers after high school or junior college. Many of us have tried to make the division one team here at UCSB but we were unable to secure a roster spot. That includes myself, as I was told I was too small. So we play club baseball because it allows us to play baseball at a high level while we are focused on getting a great education here at UCSB,” Rosenblum said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The club team at UCSB is part of the National Club Baseball Association (NCBA), a national body that governs club baseball at the collegiate level. College club teams in the NCBA either do not have NCAA baseball teams at their schools or like in the case of UCSB have generated enough interest to form a club team. The UCSB club team is in the Southern Pacific West Conference, a NCBA conference that includes Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, UCLA, the University of Southern California, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton. With a 4-1 conference record and 7-1 record overall, the Gauchos trail only Cal Poly SLO in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>In early March the team traveled to play in a wood bat tournament in Mesquite, Nevada and went undefeated in four games. Despite packing four or five ballplayers to a room and living off the $8 Chinese buffet down the street from the hotel, the Gauchos thrived on the field in Mesquite. There they defeated twentieth ranked Utah State to earn a national ranking of their own. Rosenblum could not remember a time in his four years when the UCSB club team had been ranked.</p>\n<p>The team’s early season success can be attributed to each player’s dedication to improvement. Unlike the division one team at UCSB, the club team does not have access to a state of the art weight room or a hitting facility with lights. They lift in the Robertson Gym weight room or UCSB Recreation Center and make the trip over to Girsh Park near Costco to get their hacks in. Last quarter, unable to reserve a diamond at Girsh Park, they practiced twice a week at night on the Recreation Center fields. In essence, the team has embraced the old adage “where there’s a will there’s a way” when it comes to honing their craft.</p>\n<p>Off the field, Rosenblum acts as club president and is thus responsible for all the team logistics. This includes dealing with jerseys, gear, finances and arranging field time for the team.</p>\n<p>“Dealing with team dues, uniforms, gear and umpires can be time consuming but it is just part of my role as president. But really nothing has been tougher than our inability to find a field for practices and games. We are at the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to getting field reservations, below high school and even little league teams in the area,” Rosenblum said.</p>\n<p>However, things are looking up for the team as spring quarter approaches. According to Rosenblum, the team has made arrangements to practice and play at Girsh Park for spring quarter. Thus, they will no longer have to practice at the Recreation Center fields nor have to travel 55 miles south to play their home games in Santa Paula.</p>\n<p>Michael Gilbert a fourth-year math major and first generation college student, credits the club baseball team as the most important extracurricular outlet for him in college. The self-described “pride of Moreno Valley”, Gilbert has a love for the game that compares to Rosenblum’s. Quiet and humble, similar to fellow Moreno Valley native Kawhi Leonard, Gilbert has been a valuable utility player for the team the past four years. Gilbert says playing on the club team all four years of college has been his defining experience at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“To be honest, I do not think I would have been able to get this far in school if I was not playing club baseball. I did not know what I was getting myself into coming to UCSB and we all know college can be very taxing on your mind. I feel lucky to have been able to play baseball for the past four years with a group of guys that became my best friends. Joining club baseball was the best decision I made in my four years at UCSB”, Gilbert said.</p>\n<p>Communications major Erik VanWinkle, another fourth year student on the club team, has enjoyed his time playing on the club team and hopes the team can make the NCBA World Series this year.</p>\n<p>“All the games coming up in April will be huge for us. We hit the ball really well in Mesquite so hopefully we can continue doing that, play some good defense and win ballgames. The team, especially our seniors, want to make it to the club nationals in North Carolina this year,” VanWinkle said.</p>\n<p>The UCSB club baseball team (7-1) looks to continue its winning ways on April 8th and 9th, when they host a three game home series against the University of Southern California (1-8).</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76651\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76651\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/for-the-love-of-the-game-ucsb-club-baseball/","id":1905,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[1904,1903,1902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher","biography":"Not available","articles":[1905,2648,2729,3014,3035,3592,4769],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Running With History in Mind: The Emergence of Sike Azu-Irondi","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-11-at-4.36.45-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-11-at-4.36.45-PM.png?resize=649%2C380&ssl=1","description":"Speed kills.

I gotta go and run my ass off,” he told himself as he set into the starting blocks.</p>\n<p>BANG! The gunshot sounded and the junior pushed off the line, less aggressively than Sprint Assistant Coach Travis Ander-son or Azu-Irondi himself had hoped, but after 15 meters, it was time to put on a show. He was going to show why quitting a Division I football career was worth becoming the fastest man to ever grace Pauley Track. He was going to show the world his speed.</p>\n<p>Raised in San Fernando by Ihuaku and Sike Azu-Irondi, whom the eldest son describes as very strict, Sike Jr.’s parents instilled in their son a sense of discipline, respect for authority and gratitude for everything he’s been able to accomplish.</p>\n<p>The sprinter lived a normal childhood in the valley doorbell-ditching neighbors and playing hide-and-seek with friends and his two younger siblings, brother Obi and sister Adaobi, before switching to Halo and Grand Theft Auto for entertainment as they grew older.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76649\" style=\"width: 339px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76649\" data-attachment-id=\"76649\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/running-with-history-in-mind-the-emergence-of-sike-azu-irondi/sike-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?fit=2048%2C1713&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1713\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"SIKE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?fit=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?fit=888%2C743&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-76649\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE-1024x857.jpg?resize=329%2C275\" alt=\"\" width=\"329\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?resize=1024%2C857&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?resize=250%2C209&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?resize=768%2C642&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SIKE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76649\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ryan Burns / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Out of high school, the eldest Azu-Irondi was recruited to play D-I football at Nevada after just one year of playing the sport, as he excelled in WR/DB positions for North Hollywood High School. His athleticism was evident even then, with a recorded 10.68 100m time in his senior year track season as well as his 35-plus-inch vertical leap.</p>\n<p>“It was tough and a big learning curve,” Azu-Irondi admitted. “It was good, though; I made some cool friends and learned a lot. As a little freshman coming in and playing football at a D-I university, it was tough but it was fun.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi floundered in the transition to college football, though, as he redshirted his first year before transferring to his hometown community college, College of the Canyons, to live closer to his family and try to get back to a four-year university as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“At College of the Canyons I was doing my best to get out with a scholarship, but things weren’t working out, but I was still fast, you know?” Azu-Irondi laughed. “So during track season, I did what I could and did my own recruiting.”</p>\n<p>After three back-and-forths with Coach Anderson, a former sprinter at Oregon, the prospective Canyon transfer was left wondering about his future and searched everywhere for a new track home. Finally, in the summer of 2015, Azu-Irondi sent an email asking if UCSB was still interested, and his new coach responded saying that he’d be a Gaucho in the fall.</p>\n<p>An ankle injury kept him sidelined for the vast majority of his first year in Santa Barbara, but Azu-Irondi chugged through this rough patch, biding his time for a historic return.</p>\n<p>“When I kicked it on around the 15-meter mark, I made up for it,” Azu-Irondi recalled of his historic dash at UC San Diego two weeks ago. “My turnover came in, not as fast as Coach has seen me or I had wanted it, but once I turned it on, I stayed strong even though I was a little tense after having to catch up from the slow start.”</p>\n<p>“It was a solid race. I’d say like a seven out of 10.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi speaks so humbly of his 100m time, but when 10.55s flashed on the scoreboard next to his name, the San Fernando native solidified his place in the UCSB record books as the fastest man in school history — just barely beating Sandy Combs’s 30-year-old record of 10.56s.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he prefers to keep a low profile while he sends waves nationwide during his first D-I track season. But as every great runner knows, it takes a bit of arrogance to succeed on the track, and even Azu-Irondi, after enough prodding, confidently declared his goal for the season, which is as grand a goal as a college sprinter can have.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna be in the World Championships in London. I have to hit a 10.12 to get to the trials and then go from there. I don’t want to jinx it, but I could see myself doing some crazy things. Especially with the help of Coach Anderson, I’m gonna get there for sure.”</p>\n<p>A bold benchmark to set for oneself, undoubtedly, but everything about Azu-Irondi is bold. He walks around the track with his chest out and a massive smile on his face and proceeds to leave the audience stunned with his smooth stride and blazing speed. His confidence can be seen in his step, but it is partnered with a hard-working, humble upbringing that clearly has the sprinter prepped for great success.</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi is just getting started, too. With a season and a half left in his collegiate track career, who knows? Maybe he’ll leave UCSB with the 10 fastest 100m marks in school history. Every personal record will be a school record, and time is on his hands.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 and 9 of the April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div

This year, however, is different. Team USA is finally loaded, and they are trying to bring back gold for the first time in the tournament’s history.</p>\n<p>In case you may be unfamiliar with the history of the WBC and why the event came to be, here is some background. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee voted out baseball as an official Olympic sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because athletes still wanted to play and represent their home countries and their ancestral backgrounds, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association proposed an idea to the International Baseball Federation to somehow keep the Olympic-style play alive. The IBAF agreed and the World Baseball Classic was born. The first WBC would be held one year later in 2006.</p>\n<p>Modeled after the FIFA World Cup, the WBC features 16 teams that represent different countries. This year, Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, the U.S., and Venezuela are in the official tournament.</p>\n<p>Each year, however, more and more countries enter to play in the WBC. France, Panama, Brazil, Germany, New Zealand, the Philippines, Great Britain, Nicaragua, South Africa, the Czech Republic, Pakistan and Spain were represented as well. Although these countries did not qualify for the main tournament, they did play in the qualifying rounds trying to enter the WBC. I bet you didn’t know some of these countries played baseball, huh?</p>\n<p>The past winners of the WBC include only two countries: Japan (2006, 2009) and the Dominican Republic (2013). In these years, team USA did not have a roster that represented its full potential as a country.</p>\n<p>This was because the WBC title did not have much worth to players born and raised in the U.S. Instead, All-Star caliber Major League Ball Players would elect to stay in spring training to get ready for the regular 162-game season, which includes chasing the most important title of all: World Series Champion.</p>\n<p>Paired with this, there is a lot more opportunity to make money performing well in the MLB compared to playing well in the WBC.</p>\n<p>Still, this did not stop other All-Star Major Leaguers in the past from joining their respected countries. The Dominican Republic, Japan, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have all been represented by their best athletes every WBC due to one reason and one reason only: pride.</p>\n<p>Now, enter USA in the 2017 WBC. As reported by baseball beat writers and analysts, Americans are sick of being made fun of in their locker rooms for not having a WBC title yet; they are simply tired of being mocked for doing poorly in a tournament for a sport they themselves created.</p>\n<p>So what did they do? They got together the best damn team they could.</p>\n<p>Team USA is now the favorite to win the WBC because of the team’s ridiculously stacked roster. The position players representing the U.S. are Buster Posey, Jonathan Lucroy, A.J. Ellis, Nolan Arenado, Alex Bregman, Matt Carpenter, Brandon Crawford, Paul Goldschmidt, Eric Hosmer, Ian Kinsler, Daniel Murphy, Adam Jones, Andrew McCutchen, Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich.</p>\n<p>You may be thinking, where is Mike Trout? Where is Bryce Harper? Where is Corey Seager? Although these players and more were asked, they all declined for reasons stated above.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. will have the most powerful and skilled lineup the team has had in its history by far, and the most dangerous lineup in the tournament by a wide margin.</p>\n<p>Although they recently lost Cy Young winner Max Scherzer to a finger injury, the pitching staff includes other big names such as Chris Archer, Marcus Stroman, Michael Fulmer, Tanner Roark and Andrew Miller.</p>\n<p>The U.S. wants a piece of the WBC title pie. For the first time ever, they have a really good chance. With all this talent, will America’s golden boys pull through?</p>\n<p>In their first round pool (Pool C), team USA’s biggest threat will be the Dominican Republic, which is one of the few other teams that have a big-league roster. The U.S. should have no problems with the other two teams in their pool, Colombia, and Canada, but if the U.S. can beat out the Dominican Republic, then it should have a straight run for gold.</p>\n<p>Even though play will begin with a matchup between Israel and Korea at 1:30 a.m., team U.S.A. will not have its first game until March 10, at which they will take on Colombia in Miami.</p>\n<p>The final round of the WBC will take place in Southern California at Dodger Stadium from March 20-22. Do not miss the WBC. For the first time ever, team USA could be crowned the champion right here in our own backyard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76218\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76218\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/","id":1902,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

At this point, there was some uncertainty for the Giants, but they rallied when Gillaspie came through once again with a go-ahead triple off of Chapman in the 8th and Brandon Crawford added some cushion to create a 5-3 lead for the Giants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They lost their lead in the 9th when Kris Bryant tied the game 5-5, due to Sergio Romo’s unfortunate ability to give up runs. But, yet again, the Giants vociferously fought back in the bottom of the 13th, many thanks to Joe Panik’s double to drive in Crawford and make it 6-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giants fans were elated at the victory and the Cubs intimidating determination to end their 108-year World Series championship drought became less threatening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as obvious as it was throughout the second half of their 2016 season and postseason, San Francisco’s bullpen was not deep enough to carry them past the Cubs and on to another World Series championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The devastation of saying goodbye to the even-year voodoo was painful. The “BeliEVEN” cheers had died by the end of a disastrous Game 4, in which Matt Moore pitched beautifully until the Giants closers threw their 5-2 lead away by giving up four runs to the Cubs in the 9th.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some argue that manager Bruce Bochy should have never taken Moore out of the game, even though he was nearing a considerably high pitch count. But ultimately, it was a lack of skill in the Giants closers that cost the franchise and its fans another even-year celebration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As heartbreaking as the 2016 postseason was for the Giants and their fans, that even-year magic was sweet while it lasted. By defying the odds, it gave Giants fans something unbelievable to believe in. But of course, there is some hype to get an odd-year streak going, so maybe the magic is not quite dead yet after all.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76237\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76237\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/even-year-magic-against-all-odds/","id":1903,"author":{"id":317,"name":"Kayla Talley"},"related":[1902,1901,1900],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
