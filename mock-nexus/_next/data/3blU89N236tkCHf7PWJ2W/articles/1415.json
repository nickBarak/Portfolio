His remarkable total of 16 game-winning goals ranks second in the program record book and is third in conference season. Topping it all off is his feat of 226 shots which places fourth all-time in both UCSB and Big West history.</p>\n<p>Take a look inside the UCSB and Big West record books and DePuy’s imprint decorates a variety of statistics. He is the first player in Big West history to be a three-time Offensive Player of the Year, winning the award three times from 2014-2016.</p>\n<p>DePuy became the seventh player in UCSB history to receive the accolade and the latest to be given the honors since Garza in 2010.</p>\n<p>Along with taking the crown as the conference’s most dominant player for three consecutive seasons, the forward was a three-time All-Big West First Team selection over the same time span.</p>\n<p>Although he didn’t begin his collegiate career as the lethal scorer he would soon be known as, DePuy was a pivotal asset in the team’s progression since his arrival in 2013.</p>\n<p>He concluded his freshman campaign as one of four players on the team to start in all 21 of UCSB’s matches despite recording no goals that season. He was named to 2013 Big West All-Freshman Team and was also an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>Originally beginning his career as a midfielder and occasionally playing in the center back, DePuy’s journey to becoming one of the nation’s best players began with Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg’s decision to start the 6’5”, 200-plus pounder at the forward position.</p>\n<p>Prior to his first career start as striker in the Gauchos’ game against San Diego State on Sept. 26, 2014, DePuy had just one career goal. The transition proved worthwhile as the move to the top of the field helped UCSB clinch the Big West North title as it ended the year at 10-7-3 and 6-2-2.</p>\n<p>His sophomore season marked the buildup to his emergence as UCSB’s top player during the conference portion of the season to lead all players in goals at eight, game-winning goals at five, shots at 42 and points at 17.</p>\n<p>The transition to forward was most beneficial the following year as DePuy would go on to have one of the most unforgettable seasons in UCSB history.</p>\n<p>His Junior season served as a breakout year in which DePuy’s eight game-winning goals and 15 total regular season goals led the nation; he also became the fourth Gaucho ever to be named an NSCAA First Team All-American.</p>\n<p>After making the move to forward, DePuy led the nation in goals with 24 at the end of the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>As DePuy produced on the field, the nationwide exposure continued to grow, with DePuy ending the 2015 season as the fourth Gaucho ever to be nominated as a semifinalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy — an honor awarded to the top Division I college soccer player.</p>\n<p>Following a NSCAA Far West All-Region Third Team selection in 2014, the forward’s astounding junior season led to him being a NSCAA Far West All-Region First Team selection just one year later.</p>\n<p>Entering the final chapter of DePuy’s career, it was expected that the Gauchos’s opponents’ primary objective would be to contain the elite striker. While some teams did manage to reduce his role in scoring, he was never completely shut down against competition.</p>\n<p>In his final season, DePuy played a team-high 1,872 minutes, led the Big West in shots per game with an average of 3.15 and ranked sixth in the conference in goals with six. Expectations were high as he entered the 2016 season on the MAC Hermann Trophy watch list, was a CSN Preseason All-American and ended up being named to the NSCAA Far West All-Region Second Team.</p>\n<p>While the abundance of awards and milestones helped bring recognition to his great talent, DePuy was an even greater leader that remained humble and could be depended on as a team leader.</p>\n<p>His legacy is enhanced by his being a counterpart to the program’s achievement of four straight Big West North division titles and its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2011 in the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>Known for his skill and willingness to embrace the intensity of a game’s biggest moments while at UCSB, DePuy can only continue to ascend as he prepares for his MLS journey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

of the development program’s most promising prospects. Fontes played two seasons with the San Juan Academy before moving to the Sac Republic Academy, helping his team qualify for the youth playoffs in its inaugural season.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg has raving reviews of both players, “anticipating that [Fabretti] will be able to contribute assists and goals even as a freshman,” and also believes that Fontes “will really take off when he enters [UCSB’s] program” due to his excellent composure and knowledge of the game.</p>\n<p>In addition to Sac Republic FC product, the Gauchos’ head coach focused heavily on bolstering the team’s defensive depth, adding another four defenders and a goalkeeper. Incoming freshmen Kavian Kashani, a center back, and Rhys Pak, a right back, both played for two of the top academies in California, the Orange County SC and the De Anza Force Academy, respectively. Vom Steeg said he believes both players can become two of the program’s best defenders.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Ricardo Montoy will be transferring from Taft College as an incoming junior to bring more competition to the position after allowing just 16 goals in 24 games last season, including 14 clean sheets and a Conference Goalkeeper of the Year award.</p>\n<p>The final California-recruited defender is Giovanny Acosta — who won three national championships with local Santa Barbara Soccer Club, most recently in 2016 —  will likely deputize for last year’s starting left back Randy Mendoza, a senior next season.</p>\n<p>Acosta’s club teammate, forward Rodney Michael, will also make the transition to UCSB; the creative forward scored 62 high school goals and won a CIF title within three years of moving to the U.S. from Sierra Leone, as well as being named to the U-18 National Championships Best-XI when he starred in SBSC’s winning run.</p>\n<p>Midfielder Hanno Antoni of Mannheim, Germany is one of two international recruits of the Gauchos’ 2017 class. Antoni is a transfer from Berry College, where he was named to the Division II First Team All-American team last season after leading his league with 13 goals and four assists. By recruiting Antoni, Vom Steeg is expecting to add goals and experience to a midfield already dominated by Big West Midfielder of the Year Kevin Feucht.</p>\n<p>Antoni is joined by international recruit 17-year-old Pablo Adrian Adames, who is coming to play for UCSB from Santutxu FC Juvenil B in his hometown of Bilbao, Spain. While in Spain, the center back played in the National League, the country’s second-best youth league.</p>\n<p>Much like center back/defensive mid-Daniel Amo, a freshman last season, Adames seems like a defender who will fit into the attacking-minded style the Gauchos prefer.</p>\n<p>After watching five freshmen — Noah Billingsley, Daniel Amo, Titouan Le Roux, Lamar Batista and Mateo Restrepo Mejia — all cement their rightful spots in Vom Steeg’s rotation last season, it’s fair to expect the same from this year’s class, which appears to feature an equally impressive level of quality. Hopefully, they will build up the program for the future, as the veteran head coach has made a habit of in his 18-year UCSB career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 9th, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-secure-standout-frosh-class-on-national-signing-day/","id":1414,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1413,1412,1411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nick DePuy’s Possible Impact in Montreal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-12-at-12.54.55-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-12-at-12.54.55-PM.png?resize=737%2C402&ssl=1","description":"After a historic four-year career as a UCSB Gaucho, former men's soccer star Nick DePuy is turning his dreams into a reality after being drafted by the Montreal Impact. With the talent and potential t...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Heading into the MLS SuperDraft Combine last month, former UCSB men’s soccer star Nick DePuy was turning heads after finishing his incredible college career, according to Paul-Michael Ochoa, the MLS’s communications coordinator, indicating he could climb up the board to become a top-10 pick. On draft day, DePuy dropped to the 19th pick, but couldn’t have landed in a better MLS setup than the Montreal Impact’s.</p>\n<p>The two parties have the potential to be a perfect fit, with style of play and current squad being the two leading factors in DePuy’s chance to make an immediate contribution to an already title-contending roster. Montreal is a well-organized team that loves to break forward quickly through the wings, much like UCSB, and despite his professional inexperience, the Irvine native will enter the league as one of the premier physical forces.</p>\n<p>In a Florida training camp friendly last week, the former Gaucho scored both goals in the Impact’s 2-0 win over University of Southern Florida, with his strikes assisted by first team regulars Dominic Oduro and Patrice Bernier. Within weeks, the striker has impressed alongside Montreal’s best players — a good sign signs this far into his infant career.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>(Fast forward to 0:55 for DePuy snippet):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKaZILxZB1I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Towering at 6’5” with a sturdy frame and a decent leap in him, DePuy has always been able to establish him as a presence around the goal: able to sniff out chances with both feet, and more notably, his head. The frontman was always able to find chances for himself in college, averaging 30 goals in 55 appearances after Gaucho Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg permanently switched the then-midfielder to the team’s lone striker midway through DePuy’s sophomore year.</p>\n<p>The Impact’s first-round pick joins a team that lost in extra time in the playoff semifinals against rivals Toronto FC; the former two-time all-American and three-time Big West offensive Player of the Year is lucky enough to ply his trade up top with the service of some of the best international stars in the league.</p>\n<p>Midfielder Ignacio Piatti of Argentina was tied for fourth in the MLS with 17 goals, to go with a team-high six assists, establishing himself as Montreal’s most creative attacking player in a forward-minded midfield role. Ghanaian right winger Oduro is the team’s biggest wide threat, scoring six goals while tying Piatti with six assists, and assisted on DePuy’s first goal against USF with a nice cutback pass. On the left, wingback Ambroise Oyongo returns to the Impact fresh off winning an African Cup of Nations title with Cameroon, playing every minute of the tournament and establishing himself as one of his nation’s very best defensive options.</p>\n<p>If DePuy is able to earn himself chances in the first team, there won’t be a shortage of delivery from Montreal’s best servicemen, and by looking at the team’s apparent lack of squad depth at striker, the chances could very well be there for the rookie hitman. With Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba’s departure (and most likely retirement) at the end of his 10-goal, six-assist season last year, the team lost in him its most reliable forward and only has a combined 14 league goals last year from forwards still on the roster.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s direct competition for playing time will be Matteo Mancosu, who led returning forwards with seven goals after joining the team in July last year on a year-long loan from Italian side Bologna. Although the Italian will most likely be the first-choice striker at the start of the MLS season next month, it wouldn’t be too unreasonable to expect a similar goal return from a player of DePuy’s poaching prowess.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara legend proved himself in Vom Steeg’s system as a superb holdup play outlet in the middle of the park, distributing to the team’s skillful attacking players, much like Drogba’s role in last year’s Montreal side; the former Gaucho’s work rate in the press is noticeable as well, often times nicking the ball away from defenders in advanced positions. DePuy also scores around half of his goals from headers, and with height and athleticism to match up against the MLS’s biggest defenders, his skill set seems like it could translate seamlessly into Head Coach Mauro Biello’s attack.</p>\n<p>The Impact’s season begins March 4 on the road against the San Jose Earthquakes, and although it’s highly unlikely to see DePuy play significant minutes, he could end up being picked for the bench as a second-choice striker. Depending on how Biello feels about his bright prospect after the last month of the offseason, who knows — maybe some substitute appearances aren’t too far on the horizon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB was the most represented side in the league in the regular season awards.</p>\n<p>“It shows that we have strong players and a quality team,” Feucht said. “It goes to show how much we’ve found each other this year, and we were unbeaten until the last game in conference so we’ve shown we’re a good team.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Cal State Fullerton had its fair share of match-winners too. Senior striker Alex Heilmann leads the Big West with 11 goals and was one of three Titans named to the All-Conference First and Second Teams. The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>In hopes of countering the Titan’s sheisty defense, the Gauchos bring plenty of firepower up top, averaging 1.58 goals for almost 0.3 goals per game more than CSUN, the second most prolific offense in the conference.</p>\n<p>Much of the threat comes from the trio of Selemani having tallied seven goals, DePuy with six and Feucht rounding things out with 10, whose interchanging runs in the front have picked open Big West opposition all season long. España leads UCSB with seven assists.</p>\n<p>“You have to ask me after the game whether we’re the best offense or they’re the best defense,” Feucht said. “We have to play to find out.’</p>\n<p>When the two teams faced off earlier this season at Fullerton, the host gave the Gauchos a tough match, but the visitors ended up heading back to Santa Barbara with a 2-1 overtime win thanks to Kevin Feucht’s match winner on an assist from España. The Gauchos star-studded attack will pose the sternest test Fullerton has faced in weeks.</p>\n<p>As for injuries, all of the regulars are healthy for UCSB, and the highly promising freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, who has missed most of the season with a groin injury that he aggravated again at home against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Amo is hoping to fight back into the team as the postseason picks up. His injury against Poly was far less serious than his first setback of the year, keeping him out of training for a couple weeks, but the first-year product has a chance to come back into the squad in the next match.</p>\n<p>The semifinal will take place at Harder Stadium on Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 7 p.m. Follow <em>@thenexus_sports</em> for all things Gaucho soccer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/","id":1412,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1411,1410,1409],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
