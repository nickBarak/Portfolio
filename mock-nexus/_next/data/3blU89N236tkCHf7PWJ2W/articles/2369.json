She said, however, that she still lives in “a constant state of fear” because DACA does not protect all members of her family, including her mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming from someone who has an undocumented mother, I worry more about her than I worried about myself,” Islas said. “DACA never protected my mom and that was my biggest concern.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution Tuesday in support of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DACA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supervisors Janet Wolf, Joan Hartmann and Das Williams were the resolution’s staunchest supporters; supervisors Steve Lavagnino and Peter Adam, however, abstained from voting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Hartmann said while the resolution was primarily a symbolic gesture, she believes symbols are “vitally important” for local communities to impact the federal government’s policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the resolution was a statement that the County values our Dreamers and we have a welcome sign at the door,” Hartmann said in an email. “They should know that we want to invest in their futures because they are critical to the County’s future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Sept. 8 in response to President Trump’s repeal of DACA. Napolitano alleged that the “unlawful” repeal violated the rights of the people that benefit from the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC also allocates $2.5 million per year for undocumented student fellowships under Napolitano’s D.R.E.A.M. loan initiative, and grants the UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States Supreme Court recently turned down a case challenging the UC Regents’ decision to allow undocumented students access to financial aid and pay in-state tuition fees in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Trump has given the DACA repeal to Congress, which can suggest a replacement for DACA in six months before the president officially abolishes the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said while she does not trust Congress, the best form of a new system for the undocumented community would include an updated D.R.E.A.M. Act without the enforcement of border security and detention centers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some safety coming from legislation would be abolishing detention centers,” Islas said. “But I don’t believe the liberation of the undocumented community comes from a piece of legislation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure there’s something that’s viable that protects the 11 million [undocumented immigrants],” she added. “It’s not impossible.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79007\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79007\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/daca-recipient-repeal-is-wake-up-call-urges-action/","id":2367,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2366,2365,2364],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"$48 Fix: A.S.

According to the $48 Fix report, tuition could be free for university and college students in California with the implementation of a statewide income surtax of $48 per year for the median California taxpayer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While the Senate’s approval of the resolution is primarily symbolic, it will prompt action from the executive branches of A.S. to hold campus-based campaigns, UC Student Association and U.S. Student Association meetings, as well as lobby visits with state representatives to gain support for the plan throughout the state.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would like to see people direct their energy and anger to their local legislators,” Woodrow Davidson, EVPSA deputy chief of staff and one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said. “That’s where people need to begin ramping up the pressure. In the end, it has to pass through the state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution was the first item on the agenda at the senate’s first meeting of the year and was authored by senators Dhishal Jayasinghe and Andrea Reyes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Tuition [that is] free is not a ridiculous idea,” Reyes told the <i>Nexus </i>on<i> </i>Tuesday. “It’s something that is possible in our state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Reyes is a transfer student and said the cost of a public university was the primary reason she chose to attend a community college before coming to UC Santa Barbara. She said, however, that she believes even the cost of community college can be a financial burden for many students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Spencer Brandt, one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said in a changing world and economy, the state must invest in higher education and not only fund K-12 education.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s important to have [senate’s] support to continue the movement for free college in California and gather momentum at the grassroots level,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Davidson told the <i>Nexus</i> on Tuesday he planned to attend a community college after high school because of its affordability, but his father encouraged him to attend UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He reminded the senate at the meeting that a UC, California State University and community college education was originally free. He said he believes the current political climate of instability presents students with an opportunity to make important changes at the higher levels of government.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is the moment that we seize on,” Davidson said. “This is the moment that we can truly make a better future for not just ourselves but for the people who will be coming here years down the road.”</p>\n<p><em>Anjalie Tandon contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79002\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/48-fix-a-s-supports-plan-that-could-make-higher-education-free/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79002\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/48-fix-a-s-supports-plan-that-could-make-higher-education-free/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/48-fix-a-s-supports-plan-that-could-make-higher-education-free/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/48-fix-a-s-supports-plan-that-could-make-higher-education-free/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/48-fix-a-s-supports-plan-that-could-make-higher-education-free/","id":2366,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2365,2364,2363],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: A.S.

President Hieu Le said it was “everything [he] expected it to be.”</p>\n<p>“I know it was going to be challenging,” Le said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>. “But I know what I signed up for and I’m proud. I would do it again if I could.”</p>\n<p>Le, who ran with Campus United during 2017 Spring Quarter elections, was elected over his Isla Vista Party opponent Nawar Nemeh and became UCSB’s first transfer student president.</p>\n<p>“I think having someone who isn’t shy to stray away from conventional norms was a very positive thing in terms of being a transfer,” Le said. “I think having a fresh, innovative perspective [is good] as someone who hasn’t been bogged down by the politics of A.S.”</p>\n<p>He ran on a platform of lowering student fees, “reclaiming” higher education by focusing on college affordability, creating student-owned businesses and “opening up” A.S. to historically marginalized communities.</p>\n<p>Throughout the one-year term of his presidency, he was effective in tackling issues involving sexual assault, addressing college affordability and opening up A.S.; however, he fell short on creating student businesses and working to lower student fees.</p>\n<p>Le addressed his first platform item, tackling college affordability, in part due to his work as a delegate within the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“Being a delegate to the California Democratic Party put me in a unique position to address [college affordability] first hand,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Le said the position allowed him and UCSB Lobby Corps to successfully address college affordability, particularly food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“We had brought forth the concept of food insecurity, which at that time was kind of a new concept, and we had told [Monique Limon] that 48 percent of UCSB students were food insecure,” he said. “Subsequently, after her term began in 2017… she introduced legislation on our behalf.”</p>\n<p>He explained the bill “ended up becoming multiple different things” but eventually <a href=\"http://ahed.assembly.ca.gov/sites/ahed.assembly.ca.gov/files/hearings/AB%20453%20analysis%202017.pdf\">Assembly Bill 453</a>, which was adopted into the state budget, resulted in $3.5 million in state funds that would be used to address food insecurity system wide.</p>\n<p>UCSB received $250,000 of that money, according to Le.</p>\n<p>He explained that the Democratic Party adopted “the most progressive party platform in the country,” which included having tuition-free colleges.</p>\n<p>“I was proud and fortunate to be a co-sponsor for that resolution,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Le said he and Lobby Corps lobbied against the proposed UC Regents tuition hikes, when the regents proposed another tuition increase.</p>\n<p>Since the year 2000, 90,000 students have been enrolled systemwide, but UC still receives the <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/support-uc/ucan/state-budget\">same level of funding</a>, according to the UC website.</p>\n<p>In mid-march, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised out-of-state tuition</a> and postponed the vote on in-state tuition following backlash.</p>\n<p>While not an item on his platform, Le said he is proud of “protecting the health and safety of students” during the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a> by asking UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang to delay Fall Quarter final exams.</p>\n<p>When the Thomas Fire first hit the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties during early December, Yang initially said the Fall Quarter would continue as scheduled.</p>\n<p>However, following several power outages and “hazardous” air quality, Le “pushed back against faculty who did not want to be inconvenienced” and met with Yang to discuss <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\">moving finals.</a></p>\n<p>Le said he sent an email to Yang, asking him to cancel finals and classes, and Yang had responded asking to meet.</p>\n<p>“[He] wanted to hear what my consultation was, in terms of what the student body needs,” Le said. “I told him, as I stated in my letter, that classes needed to be canceled, and finals need to be canceled, and that is what happened… I remained firm in my belief in protecting the health and safety of the students.”</p>\n<p>Winter Quarter began a week later than initially scheduled and Fall Quarter finals took place the week of January 8.</p>\n<p>“Having test anxiety … in addition to horrible conditions, no student should ever go to school when it was that unsafe,” Le said.</p>\n<p>On women’s issues, particularly regarding sexual assault, the A.S. President’s office was involved in the creation of a UC-wide <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">Title IX student advisory board</a>, according to Le.</p>\n<p>The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>Le said he, UC Title IX coordinator Kathleen Salvaty, UC Los Angeles student body president Arielle Mokhtarzadeh and several staff members from the UC Title IX office worked so students could have an opportunity for “real, substantial change.”</p>\n<p>“[We wanted] to be able to address many of the dangerous things that were happening federally, especially with the Title IX rollbacks from the Obama-era guidelines,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Salvaty <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/first-uc-system-wide-title-ix-coordinator-resigns/\">later resigned</a> in part due to the daily commute of the job and the board is currently working on potential amendments to the UC system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>While Le succeeded in several items on his platform, he failed to lower student fees and worked to raise them during Spring Quarter with the “NewCen” project.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\">project</a>, which involved an innovation lab, renovated food bank and a drastic remodel of the University Center, would have eventually increased student fees by close to $100 a quarter, a number that would rise due to inflation.</p>\n<p>It failed with 81.69 percent of students voting no on the A.S. Elections ballot, but not before the project became a source of controversy across campus.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say there’s anything I would have done differently with the NewCen, but I would say that I still stand by my decision to push forth that measure,” Le said.</p>\n<p>He said his decision to push for the renovation was “in line with [his] campaign values” because the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">UCen</a> is a “dying building.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very shortsighted for students to be paying into a building right now that’s dying,” Le said. “The fact that the value of those dollars that would be spent on revitalizing is worth a lot more than what is currently being paid into a building.”</p>\n<p>To the point of addressing student-owned business, Le said he was unsuccessful with his promise of student-owned businesses, because this would have been addressed in the failed UCen proposal with the innovation lab.</p>\n<p>“We formulated a very comprehensive plan… to be able to give students the opportunity to go innovate, start their own business, and take their own ideas to the marketplace,” Le said. “We attempted, and that is just the way that democracy works.”</p>\n<p>Le’s successor, Campus United candidate Brooke Kopel, won by a narrow margin of 2.04 percent over her opponent Justice Dumlao, who ran with the Isla Vista Party.</p>\n<p>Kopel, a third-year political science and history double major, is currently on the A.S. Senate as a letters and science senator and was the first senate pro-tempore.</p>\n<p>Le praised Kopel’s capabilities and encouraged her to take time to do the things she loves outside of the job.</p>\n<p>“She’s gonna do a great job,” Le said. “One piece of advice I would say is try to enjoy your senior year as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The bill is Assembly Bill 453, not Assembly Bill 451, as previously stated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
