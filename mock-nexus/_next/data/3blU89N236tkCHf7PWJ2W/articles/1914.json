however, can we truly distinguish OBJ within the cohort of diva receivers?</p>\n<p>What I like to consider as the entertainers of an offense, wideouts suitably have a more flashy approach to the game in comparison to other positions on the field.</p>\n<p>As a receiver, the mentality is different.</p>\n<p>Matched up one-on-one against a cornerback for the majority of a game, some receivers’ mindsets are ingrained with the notion they can’t be stopped by any defender on the field.</p>\n<p>Adding a diva presence to this outlook can be the flashy celebrations or nonchalant attitudes toward the media that some receivers express.</p>\n<p>With a history of receivers such as Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, Terrell Owens and Randy Moss as prime examples within the class of divas, it seems every few years there is a new name that emerges.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73496\" style=\"width: 418px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73496\" data-attachment-id=\"73496\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/football1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=2550%2C3300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2550,3300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"football1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?fit=791%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73496\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1-791x1024.jpg?resize=408%2C528\" alt=\"Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus\" width=\"408\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=791%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 791w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=193%2C250&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Football1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73496\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nathan Campos / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Known for his touchdown celebrations, blond-dyed hair, Head &amp; Shoulders commercials, gracing the Madden 2016 cover, having a friendship with Drake and, of course, the unforgettable one-handed catch, Beckham is constantly surrounded by the glitz and glamour of superstardom, especially while in one of the nation’s biggest markets: New York.</p>\n<p>Currently in his third season, Beckham is well-deserving of the praise he receives for his performance on the field. His 2,744 receiving yards through his first two seasons is the most in NFL history, eclipsing the previous record of 2,726 yards set by Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Although his immediate impact will be considered, the question of whether Beckham belongs within the diva class still persists.</p>\n<p>Quite frankly, the answer is no. Beckham is not a diva.</p>\n<p>It’s as if people have forgotten the exuberance and appreciation we had when tuning in not to watch the New York Giants play but rather to see the performance of Odell Beckham Jr.</p>\n<p>From the pregame catching drills full of one-handed snags to graceful jumps in the air displaying his vertical explosiveness, Beckham has served as the main attraction since his introduction to the Big City of Dreams.</p>\n<p>Sure, each player has their own way of expressing their anger when frustrated or dealing with overcoming the challenge of biting on the bait of an opponent, but is it plausible to define a player by such a behavior?</p>\n<p>In the case of Beckham, excluding his fiery and sensitive character when on the field, he hasn’t been a true detriment to the Giants’ success.</p>\n<p>While he deserves to be held accountable for the penalties he has amassed this season, a total of three (one apiece for taunting, unsportsmanlike conduct and offensive pass interference), Beckham has yet to be the reason as to why the Giants have lost games.</p>\n<p>With Super Bowl XLVI being the New York Giants’ last postseason appearance, it’s safe to say that OBJ is not an inhibiting element in the team’s playoff hopes.</p>\n<p>But football is a team sport in which brotherhood is vital to the locker-room culture, right? No individual player should be excused of the team’s successes and failures, correct?</p>\n<p>Despite the truths of both of these questions, the team loyalty of players such as quarterback Eli Manning and first-year Head Coach Ben McAdoo has to be acknowledged as they both proclaimed Beckham’s sideline acts to be a distraction to the team.</p>\n<p>Yes, Beckham was a distraction. But shouldn’t these issues be attended to and resolved internally? The calling out of Beckham just added more fuel to the fire in painting the progression of the wideout receiving the diva label.</p>\n<p>By making claims of football not being fun anymore to celebrating on the sidelines, mocking his incident with the kicking net in the form of a proposal, Beckham has become one of the league’s most unpredictable personalities.</p>\n<p>Of course it is always more appealing to be on the positive end of this spectrum, but sometimes the reserved or under under-the-radar demeanor of some players doesn’t exist for all.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider the Hall of Fame career of Terrell Owens.</p>\n<p>Second in all-time NFL career receiving yards with 15, 934 yards, third in receiving touchdowns at 153, sixth all-time in career receptions with 1,078 receptions, the record holder for receptions in a single-game with 20 to go along with a multitude of other accolades, Owens is one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history.</p>\n<p>While his renowned talent and statistical achievements surpass the qualifications of a Hall of Fame nomination, it was the diva stigma that prevented Owens from being a first ballot Hall of Famer.</p>\n<p>Yes, Owens was a diva, beyond the behavior of Beckham thus far. Yes, he did play on five different teams in his NFL career. But, most importantly, he produced when it mattered most and at some point reigned as the league’s best wide receiver. These are facts that should have outweighed personality in the evaluation of Owens.</p>\n<p>Two different players, two different personalities cut from a different cloth.</p>\n<p>The narrative of the diva wide receiver remains and is here to stay. However, the headlines and perceptions formed are only parts to a story that has yet to be fully disclosed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of October 27, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-27/the-diva-charade-is-obj-its-next-victim/","id":1914,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1913,1912,1911],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White","biography":"Not available","articles":[163,251,282,290,292,293,300,302,311,312,314,315,316,327,328,329,337,338,340,341,343,345,347,349,350,351,353,356,357,361,362,363,364,365,368,370,372,373,375,376,379,381,382,385,387,389,391,392,393,395,396,398,401,406,407,408,414,426,447,452,453,455,468,471,487,488,492,504,506,507,513,517,528,529,530,583,585,601,674,975,1208,1363,1415,1428,1430,1443,1473,1775,1776,1777,1872,1873,1881,1886,1889,1890,1893,1908,1911,1914,1971,1974,1984,1993,2005,2020,2021,2025,2849,3280,3283,3284,3290,3298,3299,3304,3306,3310,3322,3323,3325,3338,3381,4102,4954,4981,4988,4991,4996,5041,5044,5049,5055,5070,5071,5072,5073,5074,5075,5076,5077,5079,5080,5081,5082,5088,5089,5097,5098,5120,5121,5151,5152,5317,5340,5342,5343,5345,5347,5349,5365,5367,5368,5369,5371,5384,5387,5388,5389,5390,5391,5393,5394,5395,5401,5479,5509,5543],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Not Defined By the Dime: The Transformation of the 1","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=299%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/unnamed-1-2.jpg?resize=299%2C409&ssl=1","description":"The role of the point guard has managed to evolve heavily throughout the past decade leaving Sports Editor Sean White to examine those changes and how it has affected the NBA landscape.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As players evolve, so do the qualifications of their respective positions and roles.

What should be taken into full account when evaluating and labeling a point guard with what has become such an unpredictable status? Is it assists? Points? Plus/minus value? Postseason success/experience?</p>\n<p>No clear-cut answer prevails, and there’s no guarantee as to whether or not there will ever be one. Yet, the time is now to acknowledge and appreciate the mounting progression of the point guard earning more stardom in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The traditional approach of being a pass-first, low-scoring point no longer defines the coveted floor general. Although the fundamentals of being able to run and orchestrate the offense from the top of the key are still staples, the “one” has transformed into a more versatile entity within itself.</p>\n<p>While various elements, including the type of offensive/defensive systems implemented, player roles, scouting, coaching and executive responsibilities, each have an influence on player performance, point guards are reaching a new pinnacle of significance.</p>\n<p>NBA history has been rewritten following the milestones of point guards over the years.</p>\n<p>From Derrick Rose becoming the youngest NBA MVP ever to Steph Curry becoming the first ever unanimous NBA MVP in his second-straight winning of the award to Russell Westbrook breaking Oscar Robertson’s record by setting the new single-season triple-double record at 42, the NBA’s longtime “Where Amazing Happens” campaign seems to be most fittingly applied to today’s arsenal of point guards.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the 2017 NBA Draft — set to take place on June 22, 2017 — the point guard position is set to be the most coveted cohort of players on the board in the early portion of the first round.</p>\n<p>It is possible that five point guards — Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina — could be selected in the lottery, which would be the most since 1999.</p>\n<p>While the upcoming class of point guards will anticipate adding their own style to the game, the diverse makeup of today’s offensive leaders include a nostalgic nature as well.</p>\n<p>Reminiscent with the likes of legends Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Oscar Robertson, the notion of the “point forward” is even more relevant in the NBA today with the emergence of the aforementioned Antetokounmpo and James or the 76ers’ decision that Ben Simmons will run the point in his debut next season.</p>\n<p>Likely to be judged as oversized or too uncoordinated for the point position if viewed by the standards of the ABA or NBA’s early years, the developing trend of bigger, stronger and massively built players has changed the prototypical state of the point guard for the better.</p>\n<p>Just look at the hype and frenzy we all went into when then prospect 7-footer Thon Maker’s basketball highlight tape went viral on social media, with him coming up the court and performing AND-1 like, ankle-breaking crossovers while pulling up for shots from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p>Surely there’s no way anyone could discredit the heart and talent of current playmakers like Chris Paul or Isaiah Thomas, who are on the shorter side of the height spectrum, but the existence of the “Space Jam” Monstars build (for lack of a better word) of players transitioning into point guards is fascinating and fun to watch.</p>\n<p>Despite the contrast in build and body frame, this same transition applies with players like James Harden, who was named the Houston Rockets’ point guard after the hiring of Mike D’Antoni and has exceled since then. He finished the 2016-17 NBA regular season with career highs in points per game, assists (11.2) and rebounds (8.1), leaving many in favor of him winning the NBA MVP award.</p>\n<p>With an ability to create his own shot and drain it from either short or long-range distances and drive and kill defenders off with his signature Euro-step or draw fouls, Harden’s skillset has been enhanced most by his improved vision on the court when scoring or finding open teammates.</p>\n<p>But the dynamic of the point guard doesn’t end with size, athleticism, scoring or passing ability; it also includes the slashing and aggressive nature of players such as potential NBA MVP Russell Westbrook and John Wall.</p>\n<p>Although everyone is entitled to and possesses their own liking for each style, the NBA point guard has become somewhat atypical due to the fact that it’s a position constantly redefining itself.</p>\n<p>With the NBA playoffs in full effect, all of the league’s top point guards are performing on the game’s biggest stage. It is time for us all to delay the “elite” discussion and appreciate what’s available at the moment before it’s too late, and all that’s remaining are game highlights and jerseys in the rafters.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

The backlash mainly took shape in the form of student-created petitions that circulated earlier this summer, asking Yang to step down from his role as chair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the speakers, Hawaiian activist Laulani Teale, emphasized that the crux of the conflict between Native Hawaiians and TMT is a matter of consent, as the developers of TMT are operating on land where many people native to it were not given the chance to approve the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation continued, Pisciotta moved on to address a common accusation the protestors faced, that by standing against TMT, Native Hawaiian protestors are also standing against science. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nobody’s against science,” Pisciotta said. “The science was asking us, ‘What is our alternative [to building TMT]?’ But that question doesn’t belong to us. It actually belongs [to those working on the telescope].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How can you build something 18 stories high, [with a] stadium-size footprint and not frustrate the endangered species and the land and the water of Mauna Kea? So the question now becomes ‘How does science innovate to find a better solution that doesn’t do that?”’ she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July, dozens of Hawaiian elders were arrested for obstructing Mauna Kea’s only access road, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/science/mauna-kea-protest.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including Liko Martin, the “Bard of Aloha ‘Aina,” who attended Tuesday’s town hall. Martin spoke, sang and played guitar to the town hall’s attendees, performing several songs in which he wrote about Hawaii’s occupation by the U.S. government and the proposed development of TMT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin compared his time in the Hawaiian courthouse after he was arrested for protesting to being on an “auction block,” with a frenzy of lawyers vying to represent the elders as they entered the courthouse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was 33 of us [arrested]. The night before we went in there … I got the feeling [that] tomorrow we’re going to be on the auction block,” Martin said. “That’s exactly how it came down. All these attorneys are running around like, ‘We’ll take this one!’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was like throwing my fishing hook in [the courthouse]. I didn’t even have to put any bait on it,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are currently 13 other telescopes on Mauna Kea, but none as expensive as TMT, which is estimated to cost over a billion dollars, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times Reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; $300 million of the funding will be provided by the UC and Caltech, partially funded through a $200 million donation from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=gordon+and+betty+moore+foundation+tmt&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS791US791&amp;oq=gor&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4j69i60l2.1253j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foundation’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees are not used as part of TMT’s funding, according to Claire Doan, UC Office of the President spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If completed, TMT will provide images 12 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/thirty-meter-telescope-will-be-most-powerful-eye-sky\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Construction on the telescope, however, won’t be complete until at least 2030, assuming construction begins in 2020, Teale said.

Otherwise, TMT’s lease for the land will expire, and “the people of Hawaii have been very clear that they have no intention to renew [the] lease.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91724\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/mauna-kea_kaiyi-yang_online/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91724\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91724\" data-attachment-id=\"91724\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/mauna-kea_kaiyi-yang_online/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=2048%2C1393&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1393\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mauna Kea_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91724\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=888%2C604\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"604\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=768%2C522&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91724\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although criticism of Yang’s involvement with TMT sparked earlier this summer, Daevionne Beasley, the Associated Students (A.S.)
