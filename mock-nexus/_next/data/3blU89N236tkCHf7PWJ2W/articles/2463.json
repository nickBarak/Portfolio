Current seniors entered college as Barack Obama began his second term as president and were a year later confronted with both the Deltopia riots and the May 23, 2014, shooting as most phased into their twenties.</p>\n<p>The self-governance movement in Isla Vista took hold later that year, and students and faculty came together to improve life in the small college town. Now, another presidential election has taken young people by the reins, and graduating students are facing the future with contrasting college experiences.</p>\n<p>The four-year graduation rate for UCSB students typically fluctuates around 68 percent, according to the UCSB Campus Profile, and 4,687 students are scheduled to attend commencement ceremonies on June 11 and 12, according to Cathy Pollock, assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_8fb6d586-3953-4c78-a23c-032c7a0f6c57\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?B8C\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" target=\"_blank\">Create pie charts</a></div>\n<p>While the majority of graduating students are seniors, this number includes students from other class levels who will be graduating early, as well as students who graduated prior to Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>Although students from the College of Letters &amp; Science are able to attend whichever commencement ceremony they choose, the largest group of students is scheduled to graduate with the social sciences division, numbering over 2,000 students. UCSB’s largest undergraduate departments are physical and biological sciences at 31 percent, followed by social and cultural studies at 14 percent.</p>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS), UCSB’s smallest college, will be graduating approximately 90 students next week. Maintaining CCS’s standard of “A Graduate School for Undergraduates,” nearly half of CCS seniors will head to graduate school next year. Approximately 20 percent of the remaining students plan to pursue graduate education in the following year, and 17 percent are headed straight to their prospective careers.</p>\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_fba0f287-85f9-47b4-a02c-ceebd29991ee\" title=\"\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?2Dp\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0; font-family: Arial!important; font-size: 13px!important; line-height: 15px!important; text-align: center; border-top: 1px solid #dadada; margin: 0 30px;\"><a style=\"color: #989898!important; text-decoration: none!important;\" href=\"https://infogr.am\" target=\"_blank\">Create your own infographics</a></div>\n<p>CCS students will be attending schools across the country including Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Duke and Berklee College of Music, according to Sara Sterphone, student affairs officer for CCS. A little over 2 percent of students will continue research at UCSB, and other students will attend in-state programs at Chapman, Stanford, UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>When the current senior class enrolled as freshmen, 44 percent of applicants were admitted to UCSB and 18,977 undergraduates populated the university. The school has since grown to accommodate 20,607 undergraduates, and UCSB accepted 32.7 percent of applicants in 2015.</p>\n<p>Along with rising numbers, UCSB’s demographics have undergone significant shifts since 2012. In fall 2015, UCSB was named a Hispanic Serving Institution due to its significant enrollment of students who identify as Chicano/a and Latino/a. Reflecting the criteria for this title, this demographic now represents 27 percent of the undergraduate population as opposed to 24 percent four years ago.</p>\n<p>To offset reduced funding from the state, UCSB has also shifted its enrollment of in-state students along with the rest of the University of California. In fall 2012, 94 percent of UCSB students were California residents and the remainder were out-of-state or international residents. In-state enrollment percentages have gone down by 4 percent as of 2015, and 6 percent of students are now enrolled from outside of California. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These changes have sparked controversy throughout the state and students and legislators are pushing the UC to prioritize residents of California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC, although disputed, will continue to change, and as seniors look back on their education, they will remember varying bits of the institutions that placed them in adulthood. For now, they scramble to complete the last of their exams and face the next few months with confusion, excitement and an ever-critical outlook. </span></p><div

all campus services on June 16, affecting access cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students.</p>\n<p>Celestino Jones, a second-year music composition major, came out as transgender during the beginning of his second year at UCSB. “I’ve been stopped at the dining commons before because I don’t look like a ‘Celeste,’” Jones said, after undergoing hormone therapy that changed his appearance.</p>\n<p>He now has the opportunity to purchase a new access card with his preferred name without having to legally change his documentation.</p>\n<p>“It grew out of the desire to support transgender students specifically, because there are many transgender students whose legal name is not consistent with their identity,” Leesa Beck, the university registrar, said. She also hopes the efforts will improve academic experiences for international students who may use alternate names.</p>\n<p>Students are currently able to change their name through Identity Services or by submitting a petition to the registrar. Certain programs, such as G.O.L.D., source data directly from the registrar’s office, but many organizations such as GauchoSpace interact with numerous other databases like Identity Services.</p>\n<p>Beginning in the summer, the registrar’s office hopes to streamline all name change requests by communicating their information to as many “data feeds” as possible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift.” — Dave Whitman</p></blockquote>\n<p>“We think we have caught most of the major ones, but there are literally hundreds around the campus, so we may continue to find ones that we have missed, and have to make updates after we go live,” Beck said.</p>\n<p>Departments that require legal verification, such as the financial aid office, Student Health and Counseling &amp; Psychological Services, are the only groups that will receive both the legal name and the preferred name for each student. Staff members at these locations will be directed to use preferred names when addressing students and legal names when submitting and verifying claims, Beck said.</p>\n<p>The new system will only allow students to change first names, requiring legal documentation to change last names. Although this leaves room for falsification, Beck said she has spoken with schools who use preferred names and found that students “almost never abuse the system.”</p>\n<p>“It would be like putting a weird fake name on LinkedIn or something. No one wants that to be the name their professors are calling them by,” she said. “So for now there will be no “policing” of the names entered. If it becomes a problem down the line, we will reassess.”</p>\n<p>The registrar’s office will be working with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to publicize and implement the changes after Spring Quarter grades are finalized.</p>\n<p>Dave Whitman, the director of the RCSGD, said “a lot of people take names and pronouns for granted” because they never feel misrepresented by their legal name.</p>\n<p>“Identities are static, sometimes someone goes by one name for a part of their life and they have a shift,” he said. “We just want students to feel like there are services in place that validate the experiences that they are having.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way.” — Celestino Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>When beginning previous quarters at UCSB, Jones said he would sometimes find himself staying quiet during roll call, waiting until the end of class to correct his teachers about his name. He is “grateful” that professors and teaching assistants will only have access to his preferred name next year, and said several other students will benefit as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very rough patch of time telling everyone what your new name and pronouns are and why they’re that way,” he said. “It can alleviate a lot of stress, I suppose, if the name that you prefer is the name that everyone calls you by.”</p>\n<p>Although the new system will be implemented throughout UCSB in the fall, Jones, who is a chair for the RCGSD transgender taskforce, said it will not be a “fix-all” for transgender inclusivity. He explained that faculty members can learn about gender identity and make students feel safe by asking them about their preferred pronouns.</p>\n<p>“I know that even though I told people my preferred name, there were still some folks who made the mistakes of using the wrong pronouns,” Jones said. “It’s all about being educated!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 26, 2016, edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Dhadkan, which means “heartbeat” in Hindi, was founded by fourth-year students Soham Tikekar and Nishitha Viswanathan during their freshman year when they were studying physics in the library.</p>\n<p>The organization manages and plans events that combine South Asian culture and the arts with charities that provide education to children in India. Its motto is “Philanthropy through artistry.”</p>\n<p>For the past three years, Dhadkan has sent proceeds from its events to schools throughout India, providing education in rural areas and money to build more schools. Last year, they were able to support three schools for an entire year with the funds they raised.</p>\n<p>Tikekar and Viswanathan said they were both “surprised” when they learned Dhadkan had won OSL Group of the Year.</p>\n<p>“We completely didn’t know we had a chance of winning,” said Viswanathan, a biopsychology major.</p>\n<p>Despite Tikekar and Viswanathan’s initial shock, Dhadkan has made incredible steps for the South Asian community in the past year, which led to its winning the award.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 40px;\"><p>“You can train people, you can educate people and [then] they can do whatever they want.”<br>\n— Soham Tikekar</p></blockquote>\n<p>From successfully hosting Nachle Deewane, an annual philanthropic South Asian dance competition in downtown Santa Barbara, to collaborating with Associated Students Program Board to bring DJ Jai Wolf to the University Center Hub, Dhadkan has made immense steps toward raising money for Indian education and bringing South Asian culture to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have accomplished a lot,” said Tikekar, a biology and economics double major. “We put in a lot of time, and it’s kind of a barrier we thought we’d have to break to get to the main campus environment. Winning this award really solidified this idea that, yeah, a cultural organization really can get to the top.”</p>\n<p>The co-founders explained that during their freshman year, they felt the South Asian presence on campus was lacking. By creating Dhadkan, they expanded the possibilities for South Asian students and made UCSB a more welcoming environment.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to make our mark on this campus, and we both grew up with Indian arts and Indian culture; we were just surrounded by it,” Viswanathan said. “Then we came here, and we kind of didn’t get that same experience, so we wanted to do something.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71639\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"443103063\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"71618\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71639\" data-attachment-id=\"71639\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1362\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-71639\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o-1024x681.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13147361_1015368195183416_4688472305176021221_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71639\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tikekar and Viswanathan announce awards for winners at the 2016 Nachle Deewane competition. <em>Courtesy of Lorenzo Basilio for UCSB Dhadkan</em></p></div>\n<p>Tikekar said Dhadkan’s dedication to children’s education in India stemmed from the group’s belief that “education is the most sustainable branch of philanthropy.”</p>\n<p>“You can train people, you can educate people and [then] they can do whatever they want,” Tikekar said.</p>\n<p>Many Indians do not receive an education past grade school, Tikekar and Viswanathan said, and so they work to provide Indian children a full education so they can achieve their career goals and provide for their families.</p>\n<p>“Even though, officially, child labor is illegal, it’s obviously still very prevalent in a country like India, so [children] automatically go into the workforce, and that’s their entire life,” Viswanathan said. “With an education … they can bring their family and themselves out of that poverty cycle.”</p>\n<p>As finals roll in and graduation day approaches, Tikekar and Viswanathan are beginning to think about their post-commencement plans and how they can incorporate their experience with Dhadkan into the competitive job market.</p>\n<p>Viswanathan said she has developed skills through Dhadkan that are “very applicable” to life beyond college, such as learning about managing and running an organization and interacting and communicating with colleagues and venue owners;

I’m looking forward to seeing where stepping out of my comfort zone is after I graduate, after I leave this one right here.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of  the Thursday, June 2, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-06-02/osl-names-dhadkhan-ucsb-group-of-the-year/","id":2462,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2461,2460,2459],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Finance Committee Drops S.C.O.R.E Funding Freeze","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last night, the Associated Students Senate met in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss a variety of issues and receive input from several community members.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58000\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58000\" data-attachment-id=\"58000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/finance-board-seeks-to-freeze-s-c-o-r-e-s-fund/as-senate-subject-is-alex-santos-by-kenneth-song_for-11-05-2014-5887/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=1200%2C714&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,714\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415227044\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate (subject is Alex Santos-) by Kenneth Song_for 11.05.2014-5887\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=250%2C149&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?fit=888%2C528&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-58000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-subject-is-Alex-Santos-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.05.2014-5887.jpg?resize=500%2C298\" alt=\"Senators discussed the issue of ratifying the Finance Board’s request to freeze S.C.O.R.E.’s funds.

If approved, all student delegates selected for the Student of Color Conference this weekend will not be allowed to attend. <em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last night, the Associated Students Senate met in the UCen’s Flying A room to discuss a variety of issues and receive input from several community members.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of this week’s meeting was the potential freezing of the Student Commission on Racial Equality’s (S.C.O.R.E.) funds. The A.S. Finance and Business Committee has recommended that the Senate freeze S.C.O.R.E.’s assets “based on allegations that SCORE violated student government bylaws through their Student of Color Conference (SOCC) delegate selection process,” according to a statement released on S.C.O.R.E.’s Facebook page yesterday.</p>\n<p>No members of S.C.O.R.E. were present at last night’s meeting.</p>\n<p>During public forum, Senator Nikka Kurland spoke for A.S. President Ali Guthy saying the president opposed the freeze. Chief Financial Officer of the A.S. Finance and Business Committee Andre Theus requested the Senate not ratify the freeze approved by the committee on Monday.</p>\n<p>“I am recommending that you not ratify the freeze,” Theus said. “Just to explain why I thought the freeze should happen is just that there was a lot of discrepancies happening … I think that’s the best resolution to this issue.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nikka Kurland proposed a resolution to increase “financial transparency” in response to Senate confusion about S.C.O.R.E.’s funding process.</p>\n<p>“They seemed very confused on how their funding works,” Kurland said. “So all this resolution does is it stipulates that S.C.O.R.E. must present all of their financial actions to the finance and business committee and to be approved directly by the finance and business committee just for the remainder of the quarter.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Controller Amir Khazaieli spoke in favor of freezing S.C.O.R.E.’s funding based on the organization’s lack of disclosure about Student of Color Conference (SOCC) funding, a UC Student Association gathering to take place this weekend at UC Merced.</p>\n<p>“According to policies and procedures, everything that [Finance and Business Committee] funds has to be open to all students in some way, shape or form. Nothing is, as of now, transparent in regards to this issue,” Khazaieli said. “Students have no say in who’s running [S.C.O.R.E.], how much money is spent on SOCC, what the sources of funding are for SOCC and how members of the SOCC delegation are chosen.”</p>\n<p>As A.S. Controller, it is Khazaieli’s job to make sure student fees are being allocated properly and in accordance with A.S. bylaws. Khazaieli said S.C.O.R.E.’s leaders are currently spending student money improperly.</p>\n<p>“I have an inconclusive set of data at my disposal to figure out whether or not student fees are being spent properly,” Khazaieli said. “I have to deem [the data] an inconsistent use of student fees.”</p>\n<p>In its press release, S.C.O.R.E. maintains that its current process for selecting students to SOCC is fair and compliant with A.S. regulations.</p>\n<p>“SCORE stands by its selection processes and deeply condemns [Finance and Business Committee] for attempting to freeze all of SCORE’s funding, which is used to support organizations and events that promote issues of diversity and inclusion of students of color at UC Santa Barbara,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>Senator and A.S. Finance and Business Committee member Jimmy Villarreal spoke to the Senate to summarize the committee’s thought process behind the freeze recommendation.</p>\n<p>“When we asked the representatives from S.C.O.R.E. questions they weren’t always 100 percent able to answer them. I want you to know I do not think they misused funds on purpose at all,” Villarreal said. “Because the [Finance and Business Committee] wasn’t really able to decide one way or the other [whether or not funds were being misused], we recommended a freeze. There is an issue of communication between S.C.O.R.E. and the rest of the Association.”</p>\n<p>Senator Nadia Blant said the proposal was pointless to approve, and would only waste time.</p>\n<p>“I want to table it indefinitely because this whole thing is really tedious and unnecessary and it could stop a lot of things in the process that are unnecessary,” Blant said. “We shouldn’t be deciding anything right now, if anything we should be talking about it later but deciding something and sticking it on at the end of this bill that really doesn’t make any sense if you think about it, would be a waste of our time.”</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 15.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: black;\">The Senate decided to table the motion indefinitely and to take no further action.</span></p>\n<p>College of Letters &amp; Science Senator Zach Goulhiane initially proposed a resolution to extend the special elections deadline because midterm elections and midterm exams occurred during the same week.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point in us pretty much cancelling this out. We’re pretty much silencing people’s voices,” Goulhiane said. “Giving them this extra time just until Sunday allows them to actually be able to voice their opinions.”</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said that according to the A.S. Legal Code, a certain number of votes must be met during the elections and so far there has been a low voter turnout.</p>\n<p>“We had three percent on Tuesday, based off of what I just heard today,” Goulhiane said. “After a day we reached five percent.”</p>\n<p>According to Goulhiane, in order to pass the A.S. Legal Resource Center fee increase on the ballot at least 15 percent of the total students’ voter population have to vote yes on the referendum.</p>\n<p>In addition to the needed 15 percent of votes, the fee increase will only become valid with a “20 percent overall turnout,” according to A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Erika Martinez said the A.S. Legal Resource Center has been campaigning for votes through outlets like University Announcements, Facebook and the <em>Daily Nexus</em>. According to Martinez, the Resource Center should not have been campaigning for votes since they did not submit a campaign bond, which would have ensured that a fee would be charged if they were to break campaigning rules.</p>\n<p>Martinez said the Senate is also to blame for the contradiction between the elections committee’s decision and the Senate’s decision regarding putting the bill on the ballot.</p>\n<p>“They as a committee voted not to have this put on to the ballot and then we, as Senate said ‘Yes, we should put this on the ballot,’” Martinez said. “So technically, this shouldn’t even be on the ballot, because this campaign bond was never submitted and we were all aware of it.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kevin Koo said Senators have a responsibility to ensure a fair and easy voting process.</p>\n<p>“As Senators, we’re also representing our student community,” Koo said. “People not having the opportunity to read the language in the ballot is, in my opinion, very wrong and unfair towards both the LRC and the candidates who are running.”</p>\n<p>The Senate discussed other options in reaching the required percentage of students needed to vote, but ultimately decided against the resolution to extend the special elections deadline.</p>\n<p>The Senate also approved a bill that outlines guidelines for publicizing conferences and retreats as well as clarified consequences for not attending these events.</p>\n<p><strong>[Correction:</strong> A previous version of this article and the headline incorrectly referred to A.S.
