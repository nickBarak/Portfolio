The debate format followed a 15-minute opening speech, 10-minute rebuttal and an eight-minute cross examination for each participant and ended with an audience Q&amp;A session. Ph.D. candidate in philosophy Keith Hess moderated the debate.</p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Opening the evening’s discussion, Gee said debates at universities cannot be based on religious dogma and should instead pursue a “practically available, publically moral status” for the issue. Gee then posed a hypothetical “thought experiment” about the ethicality of aborting fetuses.</p>\n<p>“If you were in a fertility clinic which was about to burn down, and you could save one infant in basket or save 10,000 embryos in cold storage, I doubt anyone would vote to save the embryos.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, the “cutoff line” for permissible abortion can operate at 23 weeks gestational age. Gee said although it is a contentious issue, the fetus cannot commonly feel pain at this stage.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it is necessarily wrong afterwards, but as a precaution to avoid a potential problem,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>Gee said those who factor religious reasoning into the abortion debate lack knowledge of embryotic life.</p>\n<p>“If you do in fact think the embryo has same status as baby, approximately 50 percent of embryos fail to lead to full pregnancy because of an inability to implant to the uterine wall,” Gee said. “By this logic, if you don’t think God is the number one baby death enabler, death is not indicative of the status of a fetus.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the core of his argument is that a fetus’s conceivable rights do not hold precedence to a woman’s rights in controlling her body.</p>\n<p>“A fetus and newborn baby, even if they have interests, doesn’t mean they trump all other interests,” Gee said. “I think it is possible for a woman to say ‘I cannot take care of this baby’ … it wouldn’t be looked upon well … but I think this is permissible.”</p>\n<p>In his introductory statement, Horn said it is generally wrong to directly kill innocent human beings, that fetuses are innocent human beings and that it is therefore wrong to kill fetuses.</p>\n<p>Horn then showed a series of photographs of fetuses at various stages of development from eight weeks to 22 weeks. According to Horn, abortion is the killing of a human being.</p>\n<p>“Abortion is not a passive removal of life, it is the act of killing a child via dismemberment,” Horn said. “It’s like giving someone a kidney and then ripping it out, killing him or her in a violent process.”</p>\n<p>Horn said because a fetus is a human with potential for growth, it follows that the fetus has the basic right to not be killed.</p>\n<p>“Saying an unborn is inhuman because it is just a fetus is like saying a 15-year-old is not a human because they are just a teenager,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>According to Horn, subjecting fetuses to a non-human status based on their inability to feel pain is an act of “ableism,” a form of discrimination based on stigmatizing disability. Horn also said Gee’s “thought experiment” is unfounded because logical decisions cannot be based on intuition.</p>\n<p>“My position is unborn [fetuses] are human organisms; all humans should have basic human rights regardless of their functional ability,” Horn said, “Just because we have different intuitions at different times doesn’t mean we should rely on our feelings. Instead, let’s look toward rational arguments.”</p>\n<p>The cross examination portion of the debate contrasted Horn’s requirement for a definition of personhood with Gee’s assertion that intuition plays a role in deciding the moral worth of a human in any stage.</p>\n<p>Gee said rather than a definition of personhood, the moral state of a fetus involves a “cluster of requirements.”</p>\n<p>“There is some sort of mental concept, no possibility for a rich mental life. It involves a conscious interest and desire to keep living,” Gee said.</p>\n<p>In response, Horn said a fetus does not need to consciously demonstrate its desire for life in order to be considered viable for the right of life.</p>\n<p>“I think you can have an interest in living without consciously alluding to it, because the zygote — there is some element of an interest in its living in terms of growth,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Horn and Gee began the Q&amp;A portion of the event by responding to the question of what would motivate the two participants to change their stance on the topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>Horn said he would require an argument separating the worth of humans with those of children.</p>\n<p>“I could be moved to change my mind if it could be shown that all human beings don’t have equal rights … that they don’t really have a right to live in the organ designed for them,” Horn said.</p>\n<p>Gee said he would change his position if a fetus was shown to have certain mental capabilities.</p>\n<p>“I would require something on the order of showing that the organism in question has a deep, fairly rich mental life,” Gee said. “I think if you could show that, we could be concerned with killing the life.”</p>\n<p>In a closing statement, Gee said he would like to reassert his claim that a fetus’s rights should not be considered with more weight than a woman’s “deeply personal” autonomy over her own body.</p>\n<p>“While there is some value for whichever stage the zygote or fetus is in, I don’t think it is a value that trumps a woman’s right to bodily integrity,” Gee said. “If there was a body that had the same moral status as you and me, then there would be more value.”</p>\n<p>In Horn’s closing statement, he said humans should be defined and valued by their membership in a social community rather than their functional capabilities.</p>\n<p>“Human beings should be valued not for their functions, but because they belong to this community. I think an important question tonight is ‘Who are we allowed to kill?’” Horn said. “We should have a pit in our stomach regardless of whether it is a child or a fetus, because in the end, they all have the same intrinsic potential.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Delaney Forester said she wanted to further understand Horn’s position.</p>\n<p>“Horn made a comment earlier about a biological parent’s inherent responsibility to take care of a child unless they are deemed unfit,” Forester said. “My question is, what is the deciding factor in what makes you unfit?”</p>\n<p>Hess said the audience contributed to a civil and constructive debate, allowing both speakers to properly assert their views.</p>\n<p>“I liked how the students kept it civil. There wasn’t any … hot-heads or name-calling so I think this is the way that debates should be done,” Hess said.</p>\n<p>UCSB Students for Life of America President and fourth-year economics major Katie Devlin said the event was successful in fostering a productive discussion on the controversial topic of abortion.</p>\n<p>“I thought both speakers did a wonderful job. The audience also had really good questions,” Devlin said. “It was great how we could have a civil conversation about this sometimes controversial topic.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on

id=\"caption-attachment-66193\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Attainable, Accessible, Affordable UCSB Coalition (AAAC) hosted an event titled “Teach In” at the MultiCultural Center theater Thursday night to educate students about tuition fees and student debt and to promote the upcoming “Million Student March.”</p>\n<p>AAAC collaborated with several other student organizations such as the Student Union, Office of the Student Advocate, Associated Students External Vice President of Student Affairs Office, UCSB-4-Bernie, A.S. Office of the President and UCSB University of California Student Association to inform attendees about issues surrounding the student march which will be held on Nov. 12 at 12:00 p.m. at Storke Plaza. UCSB will join over 90 other colleges, including all nine UC’s (excluding UC San Francisco), in marching to demand free public university tuition, the cancellation of all student debt and the installation of a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and fourth-year sociology and Black studies double-major Mohsin Mirza said the Donahoe Higher Education Act, alternatively referred to as the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, made tuition free for UC schools when the UC system was first founded in the 60s. According to Mirza, the act was in place up until Ronald Reagan imposed a “student fee” to attend the universities and diverted UC funding to other, less productive activities.</p>\n<p>“[Reagan] saw the UCs as promoting — basically handing out free education to a whole bunch of would-be communists,” Mirza said. “He saw the UC’s principles to educate people as dangerous, and this tied into his ideas, which were generally against public spending.”</p>\n<p>I.G.N.I.T.E. Coordinator for the EVPSA office and fourth-year biology major Clare Idehen said Reagan diverted UC funding to prison spending and mass incarceration, which “disproportionally” affects Blacks and Latinos more than other ethnicities in America with one in three black men going to prison in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>“Since the 80s, we’ve seen a huge 800 percent increase in the amount of people going to prison, and almost half of all the people incarcerated in prisons right now are for non-violent drug charges,” Idehen said. “Why are our prisons full of people who are non-violent?”</p>\n<p>According to Idehen, there are better ways to use the 80 billion dollars spent per year on mass incarceration in America.</p>\n<p>“With 80 billion dollars, we could provide preschool for every three-and-four-year-old in America, finance roads, bridges and airport jobs,” Idehen said. “And most importantly, allocate tuition at every public university and college.”<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Idehen said students around the globe are fighting for accessible education for all.</p>\n<p>“They’re fighting for the same thing we are,” Idehen said. “They’re not very different from us — they’re maybe 17 and 18, 19, maybe 16 years old going to college. They’re basically us. So it’s really great to stand in solidarity with these students, and I think it’s really important to know what’s happening.”</p>\n<p>UCSB United States Student Association Board of Directors Co-Chair and second-year political science major José Javier Magaña Mendoza said independent Vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders advocates for government subsidized college tuition through a Robin Hood Tax. According to Mendoza, it is an estate tax on stock and bond sales and a sales tax on commodities, debentures, derivatives and notes which will bring in an estimated 300 to 350 billion dollar in tax revenue.</p>\n<p>“How the tax works is that it’s just a small financial transaction tax on Wall Street, a tax that is 0.5 percent on stocks, 0.1 percent on bonds and 0.00 percent on derivatives,” Mendoza said. “This helps us because it will go to things such as jobs, housing, affordability, child care, healthcare, transportation and a big investment on the infrastructure. As students, it also goes to our higher education.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA officer, Teach In event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said internal UC worker union AFSCME 3299 supports the Million Student March because the union cares about students and agrees with the $15 minimum wage demand for all UC workers.</p>\n<p>“All nine UC’s, except UCSF, are holding marches, and AFSCME 3299 covers all those different areas, so they’re going to be having a voice in this, but mainly stand in solidarity,” Butts said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, there has been a push for Chancellor Yang and the Vice Chancellors to attend the Million Student March.</p>\n<p>“All the A.S. Executives, the GSA president and the RHA president all signed letters requesting Chancellor Yang and all of the Vice Chancellors’ presence at this march,” Butts said. “We believe that this isn’t just a student issue or a worker’s issue, but this also has to do with UC as a whole.”</p>\n<p>Teach In speaker and third-year sociology major Alex Villegas said access to education is a global issue, and protests have been happening in London and Africa, with Africa’s protest breaking out into violence.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think a lot of people are really aware that our generation is facing this on a global level, and that we’re going to be impacted,” Villegas said. “It’s not just a temporary situation, but it’s something life-long.  It’s going to impact the future generations, and at the end of the day we’re going to end up inheriting all of this. Our leaders are setting us up for failure, so if we don’t take action now, we’re essentially all screwed.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Casey Ramirez said he attended because he is struggling to afford tuition.</p>\n<p>“Debt is hard, and paying for things are a hardship,” Ramirez said. “It’s causing issues with my parents — we’re middle class and they have bad credit, so it’s hard to get loans.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said it will take a change in policy to ease the “deep debt” students in America are accumulating.</p>\n<p>“The money exists. We have enough money, we’re the richest country in the world to pay for free higher education,” Mirza said. “We all know all too well the impact the cost college can have on our families. The question is how can we make it so that this isn’t the case, so we can have the principle of free higher education.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-06/teach-in-event-held-to-discuss-tuition-fees-student-debt/","id":2640,"author":{"id":137,"name":"Mohan Saxena"},"related":[2639,2638,2637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B met in the State Street room of the UCen on campus to consider $16,851 in requests from campus clubs. The committee fully funded requests from the Mock Trial Team for $1,495, Cotillion Dance Club for $3,950 and La Escuelita for $900. A.S. F&amp;B also partially funded requests from three clubs, allocating $2,370 to the Swing and Ballroom Dance Club, $3,000 to the Women’s Soccer Club and $850 to the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA).</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the committee operated with $19,500 in Office of Student Life (OSL) funds, $6,665 in Senate Unallocated funds, $45,000 Student Initiated Outreach Program funds, $28,565 in Culture Weeks and Graduations funds, $26,480 for sports teams and $17,164 for academic teams.</p>\n<p>The Swing and Ballroom Dance Club requested $3,006 to host their “Swingin’ Hearts Swing Dance” event on Feb. 13, and was granted $2,370 by the committee and told to request funding for parking passes and photo booths from After Dark, a club that funds student-run, alcohol-free events.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major and Swing and Ballroom Dance Club representative Cecilia Gutierrez said the club provides a fun and educational experience for all skill-levels.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to providing social events for dancing. We encourage dancers from all backgrounds to participate and create a community,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Women’s Club Soccer requested $6,000 to fund travel and coaching expenses for nationals in Arizona, and was granted $3,000, the maximum funding amount allowed for sports clubs.</p>\n<p>The Mock Trial Team requested and was awarded $1,495 for travel expenses and registration fees for competitions in Arizona, Fresno and San Diego.</p>\n<p>Mock Trial member and third-year undeclared major James McFeely said members of the club compete in events that simulate courts of law.</p>\n<p>“We like to see Mock Trial as an academic sport,” McFeely said. “We’re asking for money to bring as many teams and as many people to as many tournaments we can so we can teach them the best we can.”</p>\n<p>CSSA was awarded $850 of their $1,500 request for hosting a Casino Night with live student performers.</p>\n<p>CSSA representative and second-year economics major Peilin Hu said the event allows audience members to enjoy free music and mingle.</p>\n<p>“The event aims to provide a relaxed music environment where like-minded people can perform and the audience can enjoy music,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>Cotillion Dance Club requested and was awarded $3,950 to host a weekly dance event in the Hub, where students will receive free dance lessons and socialize with other dancers.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita requested and was awarded $900 to host its annual Thanksgiving dinner with Hermanos Unidos for Isla Vista families on Nov. 23.</p>\n<p>La Escuelita representative and third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said the event allows students and families in I.V. to enjoy the holiday together.</p>\n<p>“We prepare a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with turkey and mashed potatoes,” Hernandez said. “We hold this event because Isla Vista is very densely populated by college students and we often forget there are families in Isla Vista as well.”</p><div
