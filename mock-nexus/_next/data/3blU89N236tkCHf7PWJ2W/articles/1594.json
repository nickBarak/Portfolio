It should be no different Saturday night when the No. 5 UCSB men’s soccer team hosts the rival Mustangs in a televised match at Harder Stadium expected to be the highest attended game of the season.</p>\n<p>The Big West North champion Gauchos enter Saturday night with a 10-game unbeaten streak and an 11-4-3 overall record and 6-0-3 mark in conference play. Cal Poly, meanwhile, sits tied for second in the North division at 10-7-2 overall and 3-4-2 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We’re pretty excited to play Cal Poly Saturday because it’s the last regular season game, it’s senior night and there’s going to be a lot of fans there,” freshman midfielder Ismaila Jome said. “So we’re pumped to [try to] get a win in front of our fans.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the rivals faced off weeks ago, UCSB and Cal Poly ended in a 1-1 draw in front of a NCAA season-high 11,075 fans at Spanos Stadium in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>Last year’s installment of the Blue-Green Rivalry saw 13,467 fans in attendance at Harder Stadium, the fourth highest on campus total in NCAA history. With that many fans in attendance, Blue-Green rivalry games are always noted for the booming crowds and hectic cheers aimed at the rival team.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important [to win] because we know we are a better team than them and we have to show that on Saturday,” Jome said. “A win against them, in hopefully a packed Harder Stadium, is the perfect way to end our regular season heading into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also has an opportunity to become the second team in history to finish a Big West season undefeated in conference play if they can win or tie against Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We’re obviously undefeated so we want to go into that game and make sure we take care of business, get the three points and then we’ll move on from there,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “So far it’s good, we’re still undefeated nine games in now.”</p>\n<p>With a victory or tie on Saturday, UCSB would also have home field advantage throughout the Big West Conference Tournament, clinching the top record in the entire conference.</p>\n<p>By clinching the Big West North, Santa Barbara has already secured a first round bye in the Big West tournament as well as home field advantage through the semifinals.</p>\n<p>Despite a scoreless draw against Sacramento State on Wednesday, the third-straight tie for UCSB, the Gauchos are primed to enter the NCAA postseason once again this year, regardless of the results of the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>“It was tough. We wanted to go out there and beat Sac State to get our RPI high and everything,” Baiden said. “We didn’t lose but at the same time we wanted a win against Sac State.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match features some high scoring offenses as Cal Poly leads the entire nation in goals scored and features a deadly weapon in senior forward Mackenzie Pridham who ranks second in the nation with 14 goals this season.</p>\n<p>When UCSB faced Cal Poly earlier this season, the Gauchos’ defense held Pridham scoreless in an impressive defensive effort by freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the ball, UCSB ranks third in the Big West in goals scored, but is well suited to slow down Cal Poly as the top ranked defense in the league, allowing only 16 goals this season. The Mustangs, however, rank last in the conference with 28 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be an important game for both teams,” Baiden said. “We lost against them last year so we’re going to make sure we don’t repeat that. We’re going for the win and trying to finish the season strong, going undefeated and winning against Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green Rivalry at Harder Stadium is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. and will be televised on Fox Sports West.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of November 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter

In the past two games, the Gauchos have had to play without the entire starting backline and gave up six goals, or half of the goals they let in all of last season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While freshman defender Lucas Gonzalez and senior defender Faouzi Taieb are still out with injuries for the foreseeable future, the Gauchos got back defensive stalwarts Noah Billingsley and Hunter Ashworth from international play, and they made a huge difference in last night’s game.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were on the attack from the jump on Thursday night, seemingly emboldened by their new-look defensive line to play a more aggressive brand of offense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one took advantage of this free-flowing style of play more than junior transfer Ameyawu Muntari, who simply controlled the left side of the pitch for the first 15 minutes. The Ghanian forward almost picked up his first assist of the season just five minutes in, when he burned a Bulldog defender on the left wing and lobbed in a cross that narrowly missed the leg of Gaucho forward Rodney Michael. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was able to settle in, slow the game down a bit and play more of a possession style offense in the first half, something we hadn’t really seen from the team this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashworth and Billingsley’s ability to calmly yet forcefully bring the ball up from the defensive end was key to opening up the field for the Gauchos. The game must have looked slow for the two defenders after having just played with some of the best young players in the world as part of the U-23 New Zealand international team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billingsley in particular seemed to always be just a step ahead of the Bulldog players. In the 36th minute he took the ball up from the defensive third, crossed over three Gonzaga defenders and snuck a pass to a streaking Thibault Candia, who set up Muntari with a perfect pass which he curled just to the right of the goal. The senior did a great job of balancing his offensive attacks with smart defensive plays, something that Gauchos had been missing in these last couple games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB didn’t score in the first half but dominated possession. The team took five shots as a whole, only gave up one shot to the Zags and sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach did not have to make a single save in the entire period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although their record might not show it, the Bulldogs are a tough team and they came out strong to start the second half. Gonzaga began to ramp up the pressure on the Gauchos in the first few minutes, but this also left them more prone to UCSB counterattacks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 49th minute, the Bulldogs cleared a UCSB freekick and sent numbers downfield to attack the Gauchos’ defense. Gonzaga midfielder Joe Corner then initiated one of the strangest sequences of the game when his shot ricocheted off the post, was centered back in and almost knocked in for an own-goal by Hunter Ashworth. Ashworth cleared it back out to Corner who slammed a shot straight at Ben Roach who then popped the ball up directly to Bulldog midfielder Frankie Ljucovic, who eventually headed the ball off the post and out of play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as momentum seemed to be shifting to the Zags, the Gauchos finally notched what would be a controversial yet game-winning goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 57th minute, Muntari took the ball down the right-wing and rocketed a cross straight into the Bulldog defense. The defenders botched the clearance and sent the ball straight up into the air, and both UCSB midfielder Finn Ballard McBride and Gonzaga goalkeeper Cole Rovegno jumped to make a play on the ball only to end up colliding with no call being made. As this was happening, sophomore forward Carter Clemmensen slid through the defense and pounced on the ball when it fell in front of him, knocking in his first goal of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bulldog players and coaching staff let the referee have it for the rest of the match, even after a favorable call went their way in the 66th minute when Ashworth got mostly ball on a slide tackle but was called for a foul just outside of the box. Ljucovic struck a curling free kick into the upper right corner of the goal which was saved by Roach. From that point on, the Bulldogs never really threatened again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a great win for the Gauchos as it both stopped their two-game losing streak and gave them confidence for some tough matchups in the next couple weeks. Games against Oregon State, Seattle U and Stanford will surely test UCSB before they start up conference season, but this past game showed that when fully healthy, this team is going to be very tough to beat.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2036.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/omar-hernandez/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Omar Hernandez</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Omar Hernandez currently serves as the Sports Editor.

In fact, 36 shots were taken, with 21 put on frame, proving why the Blue-Green rivalry is one of best matchups in college soccer. UCSB dominated the shot count, doubling up on Cal Poly 24-12 while taking five more shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the 75th minute, the Gauchos found the back of the net. Ryan put UCSB on the board on a diving header crossed into the left side of the box by freshman midfielder Ema Boateng. The goal was Ryan’s eighth of the season.</p>\n<p>“After he scored, I personally thought that was it,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “I thought the game was done. He got an amazing ball from Ema and it was an amazing run by Nic … it was perfect. It was an incredible goal.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB thought it had the victory, the Mustangs had a different idea. With time winding down, sophomore goalkeeper Austin Mansker came out to block the shot of junior forward Mackenzie Pridham. In an already physical game, Pridham and Mansker collided and the ball fell right into the feet of junior midfielder George Malki, who scored on an open goal with 1:06 remaining and leveled the game at one apiece.</p>\n<p>“I don’t quite understand why we’re hanging out in [Cal Poly’s] 18-yard box when there’s one minute left,” head coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “All we had to do was stay behind the ball.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs went into overtime with momentum. They took the only two shots of the period, connecting on the second approximately six minutes into overtime.</p>\n<p>Against a tired Gaucho squad, Pridham and senior midfielder Chris Gaschen played a two-man game in the box. Pridham fired a shot from the six-yard box into the opposite corner of the goal, stunning the 13,467-member audience (the fourth-largest attendance at Harder Stadium).</p>\n<p>“Our guys were dead,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re just not deep enough to go into overtime and of course, emotionally they were spent because [they] think the game’s won.”</p>\n<p>Pridham proved why he is one of the best forwards in the league, tallying a goal and an assist on the night. He recorded five shots, all on goal, en route to scoring his ninth goal of the year and his fifth game-winner.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that we didn’t clear any of those balls,” Vom Steeg said. “We just left the ball there for him to do something with.”</p>\n<p>While the game was exciting offensively, some incredible goalkeeping was also on display. While Mansker tallied a season-high six saves, Cal Poly’s keeper, freshman Wade Hamilton, saved 12 shots, a career high.</p>\n<p>Having lost three of its last four games, Santa Barbara will look to rebound next weekend when the team hosts Stanford and UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48322\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48322\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/ucsb-falls-rival-cal-poly-overtime/","id":1592,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1591,1590,1589],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fight to Draw Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mens-soccer-v-UCD_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mens-soccer-v-UCD_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB extended its unbeaten streak to nine games with the draw.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After not registering a draw in its first 15 matches of the season, the No. 7 UCSB men’s soccer team concluded Saturday night’s game at Harder Stadium with its second consecutive draw in a 1-1 decision against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s draw brings Santa Barbara’s record to 11-4-2 on the season with an undefeated 6-0-2 conference mark.

Senior defender Peter Schmetz and senior forward Achille Campion both missed the contest due to injury, while freshman midfielder Drew Murphy had to sit out because of the five yellow cards he has totaled this season.</p>\n<p>Shorthanded, the Gauchos had to rely on its depth to provide a difference maker in this match, something that never came for UCSB as both teams entered the half scoreless.</p>\n<p>“I think it was pretty evident we just didn’t have the same push as we normally would. I also thought the team, after a kind of lackluster first half, we actually played pretty well in the second half and I thought we had good energy. We wore them down.”</p>\n<p>Davis struck first in a more exciting second half with a 71st minute goal from junior forward Matt Sheldon.</p>\n<p>UCSB quickly responded, however, as sophomore Charlie Miller’s 82nd minute header kept the Gauchos undefeated streak in tact. It was Miller’s third goal of the season, which is tied for third on the team. Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez and senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko each assisted on the play.</p>\n<p>Neither team could convert in the two overtime periods, as UCSB had to settle for its second straight draw. When UCSB faced Davis earlier in the season, the Gauchos emerged with a 2-1 victory in double overtime playing up North.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB outshot Davis 14-11 but the Aggies maintained a 5-4 advantage in shots on goal. Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely made four saves for the Gauchos, while Miller led UCSB with four shots and three on goal coming off the bench.</p>\n<p>With the Big West North Division title already locked up, the Gauchos are battling to secure the top spot in the entire conference and position themselves to secure a NCAA postseason bid regardless of the Big West Tournament results.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t lose, we haven’t lost in the month of October, so we just have to take the positives out of it,” Vom Steeg said. “We have to kind of regroup a little bit and again find a way to win the next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Sacramento State on Wednesday for a 2 p.m. match.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 4, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/","id":1591,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1590,1589,1588],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
