He explained that there is currently no way to get rid of the smell.</p>\n<p>On Thursday morning, McCrary noticed a UCen closet that was filled with water from a broken sewer line.</p>\n<p>“If the UCen is rotting from the inside out, it doesn’t make sense to spend money upstairs if everything on the inside is still bursting. It’s more of a safety hazard more than anything as well, but also there’s a lot of leaks in the UCen because of the joints,” he added.</p>\n<p>Skylights above the Hub and the Information Desk have “several known leaks” that need to be repaired with new waterproofing, according to documents.</p>\n<p>Approximately 54,300 square feet of the existing roof needs to be replaced as well because it is over 25 years old and has “several known leaks.” There is also additional “water intrusion at expansion joints” at Corwin Pavilion and SB Printer.</p>\n<p>Part of the roof collapsed on March 21 in the area near the Subway in the UCen, according to Associated Students President Hieu Le. He explained that a student initially contacted him about the issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82240\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"420696172\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82231\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82240\" data-attachment-id=\"82240\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/ucen-ceiling-collapse/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ucen ceiling collapse\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-82240\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The collapsed piece of the ceiling can be seen in the photo above. <em>Courtesy of Hieu Le</em></p></div>\n<p>“It hasn’t been updated in over 50 years; we’re using a design and technology that do not meet modern efficiency standards,” Le said.</p>\n<p>There is currently no heat or air conditioning in the UCen Lobby or the Hub and the emergency generator circuit capacity needs to be expanded to include all “life safety and operational equipment,” according to the documents.</p>\n<p>Approximately $22,500 of this budget would be used to replace toilet partitions, hand dryers and other various bathroom accessories in three of the UCen bathrooms that have not been updated since 1966. These bathrooms need new water supply lines and need to be re-tiled.</p>\n<p>New “low-flow” toilets, faucets and fixtures need to be placed in the bathrooms as well, according to the documents.</p>\n<p>A total of 21 exterior doors need to be replaced and fitted with new locks. The UCen also needs to replace four of its regular elevators and one freight elevator.</p>\n<p>The sprinkler system is functional, but needs to be replaced and it is recommended that exposed sprinkler heads be concealed to prevent vandalism, according to the documents. Some of the UCen’s fire alarm control panels need to be upgraded to a campus standard networked system.</p>\n<p>“Those are the most essentially priority needs. We’ve accounted for that in the total priority costs,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Money raised by the UCen renovation project would be used to address these repairs, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“If this renovation expansion were to not happen, that operation and maintenance fee over a span of 30 years is going to accumulate to $40 to $45 million that’s spent into a current facility right now that is deteriorating and has declining value,” he said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students are paying approximately $40 a quarter in student fees to the UCen. If students <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-18/ucen-project-will-be-on-a-s-elections-ballot/\">vote</a> to pass the UCen renovation project at the end of April, student fees will increase by $20.40 until 2022, and to $96.06 until 2052.</p>\n<p>These numbers will rise due to inflation, according to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Design fees, internal feels, insurance, escalation and contingency fees are not included in the budget estimate.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a Thursday morning picture of a sewer leak in a water closet. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school. <em>Will Tran /Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition for a Better UC launched a campaign in the fall of 2017 focused on passing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assembly Bill 3153</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will extend financial aid from Cal Grant into summer sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign is expected to end in June of 2018 when the State Assembly will vote on the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coalition is requesting that the funding for this aid increase come from Governor Jerry Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s fund, which will amount to  $13.5 billion by the summer of 2019 avoids raising taxes for the extended aid, according to Eddy Chikukwa the president and founder of the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California’s Office of the President (UCOP) estimated the total cost of summer tuition for all the UCs, Cal States and community colleges would be $148 million a year, which is 1 percent of Brown’s Rainy Day Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, a third-year political science and philosophy double major, said he was inspired to start this campaign when he began working for the UC Santa Barbara Office of Financial Aid earlier last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Directors for the Cal State campuses are meeting in April to discuss and potentially approve the Bill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The board] saying they’ll legitimize it, means 23 Cal States and the 450,000 students they represent said they’re [in support of] this. It’s a really big deal for negotiating leverage with legislators,” Chikukwa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chikukwa, the coalition organizers alongside the University of California Student Association (UCSA) and the UC Regents will be going to Sacramento from March 24 to March 26 to present the bill to state legislators and ask for support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) passed a resolution on March 7 supporting this campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was presented by Mayela Morales, legislative outreach director for the Coalition, and Justice Dumlao, a third-year global studies major and communication director for the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine’s A.S. passed their own resolution on Feb. 15 sponsoring the Coalition’s campaign, and UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced are among others that are discussing their involvement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most telling signs that someone is going to graduate [in four years] is income level,” Director of Student Outreach for the Coalition, Chadwyck Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a study done by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) in 2015, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California will see a decrease of 1.1 million college graduates by 2030 due to lack of financial aid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa and the rest of the Coalition began promoting the idea of extending the Cal Grant into summer sessions in order to increase the amount of students that graduate out of UC’s and Cal States within four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Coalition’s] whole motive was to educate people first, and then build legislative support,” said Chikukwa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the bill more appealing to legislators, the Coalition is asking students to sign a petition in support of it, according to Moore,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to show [the legislators] that students are behind this and are watching every step of the way,” Chikukwa said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Grant is expected to include undocumented students as well as offer more financial aid to students from middle income families, added Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition’s platform that was presented to the A.S. claims that the campaign is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school and to “ultimately create free higher education institutions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We students need to take this matter into our own hands. Taking out loans.. only increases the over $1.3 trillion of student debt nationwide,” said Morales, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year global and chicanx studies double major</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I’m very optimistic that this bill will be approved.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article inaccurately reported that the funding will be officially coming from Governor Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and has been corrected to show that the Coalition for a Better UC is recommending it come from Brown’s Fund</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/","id":2308,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2307,2306,2305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Model U.N.

The opening ceremony will be held in Girvetz Hall, large committees will be in the Theater &amp; Dance Building, small committees will be in the Student Resource Building and the closing ceremony will be in Isla Vista Theater.</p>\n<p>According to SBIMUN Security Council Chair and fourth-year political science and Italian double major Jane Huson, their event is relatively new compared to those held at other universities and will provide students with good preparation for future MUN conferences.</p>\n<p>“Our conference is pretty new and more of an educational one since it is hosted in the fall and a lot of colleges send newer delegates so they can experience it in a less intimidating environment,” Huson said. “A lot of students will go to the New York MUN in the spring and the Berkeley MUN in the winter so this is a jumping off point for the students.”</p>\n<p>The number of travel conferences MUN will be able to attend depends on how much funding they collect from hosting home conferences. The team is planning to attend conferences in New York, Davis, Berkeley and Los Angeles this school year.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN Human Rights Council and third-year global studies Benjamin Pu said the conference will be a great learning opportunity for many students.</p>\n<p>“This is a great training conference, and for many schools it will be the first conference of the year,” Pu said. “We provide a thorough and rigorous environment for rules and procedures and also emphasize educational aspects as well.”</p>\n<p>Huson said around 400 to 450 delegates from 18 universities throughout California are expected to be at the conference, including UC San Diego, UC Davis, University of Southern California and Stanford University.</p>\n<p>Chair of SBIMUN World Food Program and first-year pre-economics Jason Tsao said he looks forward to the event.</p>\n<p>“This is my first time chairing for a MUN conference and even though it’s going to be a long three days, I’m excited,” Tsao said. “There are training sessions held weekly and that’s where delegates will learn what to do at the conferences.”</p>\n<p>According to Huson, there will be four committee sessions spread out over three days with the opening ceremony introducing chairs, committees and a guest speaker. Each committee will have two topics for discussion and will be chaired by MUN students.</p>\n<p>Huson said MUN members can learn how to be better delegates through hosting a conference.</p>\n<p>“Conferences are super helpful because students are chairing and facilitating the debates,” Huson said. “Chairs who are members will see what makes people good delegates so when they go to travel conferences they can know how to better behave and win prizes and learn what goes into writing a good resolution.”</p>\n<p>MUN will host two more annual conferences, the Gaucho Model United Nations High School Conference and the Central Coast Scrimmage, on Feb. 14-15 and May 2 respectively.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Championships for the first time in the team’s history. <em>Courtesy of Alexandria Suebert</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Mock Trial team has qualified for the American Mock Trial Association National Championships for the first time in the team’s 20-year history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team placed second behind Stanford University in the Los Angeles division of the Opening Round Championship Series (O.R.C.S.), which determined their eligibility for Nationals, which will take place from April 20 to 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only 48 of the 714 teams that participated in O.R.C.S. earned bids to attend Nationals, according to Vice President Marlon Steven Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the biggest accomplishment any team could achieve because of the high caliber of the Southern California area,” UCSB Mock Trial President and A team Captain Alexandria Suebert said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We compete against teams who have consistently placed highly at nationals and are highly concentrated within our area therefore to get a spot and be the second ranked team behind Stanford is phenomenal,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A team, which consists of Suebert, Co-Captain Blake Berich, Sudeep Dhanoa, Taylar Hender, Justine Jung, Jimmy McFeely, Marlon Steven Poroj, Kane Tenorio and Deborah Williams, is one of 48 teams that will travel to Minneapolis to compete in the National Championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s B team did not receive a bid for Nationals. However, they have surpassed their previous records, as this is the first year that both teams have qualified for O.R.C.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we were able to qualify and be put on the same playing field as our A team and qualify alongside schools that don’t take us seriously really means a lot to me, coming in as an underdog,” B Captain and Secretary Zenia Safadi said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team is student-run and receives part-time assistance from a UCSB alum who acts as an attorney coach, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to Poroj.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That fact has been disadvantageous due to the huge time commitments, no attorney coaches, high tournament fees, and travel expenses,” Poroj said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though this is the team’s biggest accomplishment to date, they have been steadily increasing their status as a nationally known team. In 2014, the team took first place in the Yale University Invitational, and this past January they hosted Mocktopia, the second-largest tournament on the West Coast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suebert praised her teammates for their motivation and persistence, a combination of which gives them “the Umph,” as the Executive Board calls it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though they are not sure of what to expect from their first-ever tournament, during which they will compete against teams from Harvard, Yale, Stanford and other Ivy League schools, Poroj believes that this is a defining moment in the team’s transformation as a team in it for fun, but also one that will “kick ass and take names.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we have never made it to Nationals before, we do not know what to expect, but we do know that only the best of the best will be competing … so we are going to Minneapolis with guns blazing,” Treasurer Janice Espindola said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/ucsb-mock-trial-nationals\">GoFundMe</a> to help pay for the trip to Nationals. </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the team did not have a coach.
