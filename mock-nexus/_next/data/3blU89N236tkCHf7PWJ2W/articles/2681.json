Ortega served two tours in Iraq, one tour in Afghanistan and is currently a helicopter crew chief stationed in Oahu, Hawaii. Ortega stepped into the national spotlight over the last year, advocating for transgender rights in the military.</p>\n<p>Ortega said the takeaway from the event should be to engage in more honest and difficult discussions about rights for marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>“Have tough conversations with people,” Ortega said. “That’s the most powerful thing you can do. They don’t have to be conversations where you attack or are in opposition, but you have to have tough, honest conversations with people.”</p>\n<p>Ortega said people have the responsibility to be involved in decision-making as conscientious voters.</p>\n<p>“We have to start the change with us,” Ortega said. “If you want there to be change … you need to get out there and vote.”</p>\n<p>According to Ortega, the Pentagon currently has a 12-person council led by Under Secretary of the Army Brad R. Carson to discuss transgender rights in the military. Ortega said the council’s decisions often correlate with the public’s opinion.</p>\n<p>“The decision about trans inclusion in the military is currently with a think tank led by Mr. Carson, the Under Secretary of the Department of the Army and 12 guys at the Pentagon with whom I correspond,” Ortega said.</p>\n<p>RCSGD director David Whitman said Ortega addressed important issues on which many students lack knowledge, such as the varying identities on a “gender spectrum.”</p>\n<p>“As a trans man and a trans masculine-presenting person, Ortega gave a lot of awareness to different identities within the gender spectrum,” Whitman said. “He talked about his journey as a trans person and what aspects of his life led to his ability to be himself and I think that was empowering.”</p>\n<p>Whitman said Ortega’s talk is also applicable to university students, though the talk focused on his experience in the military.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see UCSB students come together and prioritize diversity initiatives,” Whitman said. “There are endless communities and intersections in those communities that are very much at risk but are also very much deserving of our respect, love, attention … the more we lean into things we don’t know about … I think the healthier our communities will be.”</p>\n<p>Diversity Education Coordinator for RCSGD and third-year sociology major Khadeja Tran said the campus should increase the number of resources for transgender students.</p>\n<p>“There are also trans people on campus, a lot of them, who maybe aren’t out yet, who maybe are in between, who need the resources or help from faculty, staff and students to feel more included and for the campus environment to be more inclusive,” Tran said.</p>\n<p>Second-year music composition major Tino Jones said Ortega carried the conversation about transgender rights in the military into public focus.</p>\n<p>“Transgender appearance in the military is something that has been widely debated — whether or not [they] should be there,” Jones said. “Shane Ortega’s success is showing that you can do things even though someone may tell you that you can’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65123\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/talk-highlights-military-transgender-advocacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65123\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/talk-highlights-military-transgender-advocacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/talk-highlights-military-transgender-advocacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/talk-highlights-military-transgender-advocacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/talk-highlights-military-transgender-advocacy/","id":2681,"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo"},"related":[2680,2679,2678],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":127,"name":"Amy Koo","biography":"Not available","articles":[2532,2553,2572,2583,2594,2608,2634,2641,2651,2656,2663,2681,3868,4615],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate, reforming Science, Technology, Aerospace and Research Kapital (S.T.A.R.K.) funding and to vote on the five bills presented at last week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>The S.T.A.R.K. bill, approved in January 2013, sets aside $10,000 to be used by science and engineering student organizations on large-scale projects, in addition to their own fundraising efforts. Assistant Director of Technology Sean Lieberman, Residence Hall Association (RHA) President Matilda Mead and second-year political science major On-campus Senator Jose Magaña presented to senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>At last week’s senate meeting, On-campus Senator and second-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh presented “A Bill to Switch Associated Students Elections to a Single Transferable Vote System.”</p>\n<p>Lieberman said implementing single transferable voting, in which voters would rank each candidate, would require adapting the online voting system. According to Lieberman, UC Berkeley currently utilizes a single transferable voting system and produces election results in three to seven days, while UCSB tabulates votes within three hours.</p>\n<p>“I would call [single transferable voting] low voter patience. We’ve never asked people to rank 30 candidates in past elections,” Lieberman said. “In order to explain what effect the complex nature of single transferable voting will have on counting the votes, I read Berkeley’s elections code regarding tallying. They give three to seven days — three is the minimum — to seven days and we usually get it [the results] out in three hours.”</p>\n<p>Mead said she is working to establish RHA liaisons in A.S Senate and Committee meetings, and productivity could increase if A.S. and RHA worked together.</p>\n<p>“I’ve decided to shift the RHA’s focus to putting a greater focus on advocacy and initiative,” Mead said. “Our residents are affected the same way your students are affected.”</p>\n<p>Mead also said there may be concerns of potentially conflicting interests between students and Housing &amp; Residential Services (HRS) if RHA were to work with A.S Senate and Committees, but the benefits outweigh the potential costs.</p>\n<p>“I completely agree that some committees are not suitable for RHA members to sit on,” Mead said. “Luckily, there are many other committees that are, and all of these committees that potentially benefit from having a member the residence halls report to and from [RHA] organization.”</p>\n<p>Magaña said he hopes to increase the impact RHA has on A.S and expand the responsibilities of floor representatives, which he believes will improve student body representation.</p>\n<p>“I will send bills and resolutions that they can look over because I believe in direct representation from my constituents,” Magaña said. “We represent RHA here, but RHA has its own committee so they have a direct representation of people in the residence hall.”</p>\n<p>According to Magaña, floor representatives are willing to increase their responsibilities once they are more involved in A.S.</p>\n<p>“I’ve talked to past floor reps about retention,” Magaña said. “Some of their concerns is not necessarily about hour commitment but because they feel like they didn’t have much say even though their position is immensely important.”</p>\n<p>Magaña then presented “A Resolution to Create an Ad-Hoc Committee to Fill the Vacant On-Campus Senate Position.”</p>\n<p>College of Creative Studies (CCS) Collegiate Senator and third-year biochemistry and chemistry major Dustin Larrazolo presented bills on forming an A.S. Student Councils and establishing funds.</p>\n<p>Larrazolo presented “A Bill to Establish A.S. Student Councils” which outlines a plan to provide a legislative outlet for CCS and College of Engineering (CoE) students to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“The CCS student council held their first forum and got 40 attendees,” Larrazolo said. “[CCS and CoE] will be able to get a lot more resources that they do not have and also be more connected with A.S.”</p>\n<p>Larrazolo then presented “A Bill to Redefine S.T.A.R.K. funds” and “A Bill to Establish the Creative, Artistic, Research, and Diversity Fund,” which outlines two A.S funds to support students’ academic projects and research.</p>\n<p>Senate moved seven new bills and five old bills from last week to the Campus Affairs committee.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Packing on October 12 on the Student Resource Building (SRB) lawn from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Active Minds, a nationwide nonprofit organization aiming to change the stigma surrounding mental illness and encourage students to seek help, debuted the event at the National Mall in Washington D.C. in 2008. Since then, more than 320,000 people in 98 cities throughout the country have attended Send Silence Packing. The event displays 1,100 backpacks to represent the 1,100 college students who lose their lives to suicide each year. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for college students.</p>\n<p>Active Minds staff advisor and Associate Director of Student Mental Health Coordination Services Ryan Sims said the host organizations have worked hard to make the event possible.</p>\n<p>“The event really has been three years in the making,” Sims said. “Active Minds has partnered with Mental Wellness Center to fundraise over $5,000 to put the event on, which is something we are very proud of.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mental Wellness Center CEO Annmarie Cameron said universities have to “compete” to host a Send Silence Packing event.</p>\n<p>“The process of getting Send Silence Packing to come to UCSB has taken three years,” Cameron said. “To qualify, the university itself has to provide adequate emotional support for the students that are impacted by the exhibit and UCSB’s mental health services are exceptional for this type of event.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said she hopes seeing backpacks at the event will “make it real” for students that suicide can affect their peers.</p>\n<p>“I hope the message that people will take away is that we are all affected by suicide,” Stanford said. “Talking to your friend if you see that they’re struggling and knowing how to help someone struggling is so important for college students.”</p>\n<p>Sims said he believes the “powerful display” will prompt those passing by to consider what the backpacks represent.</p>\n<p>“Many of the backpacks were created by friends, family members and partners of those that have passed away and include the student’s personal stories, pictures and treasured personal belongings,” Sims said. “I’m most looking forward to UCSB students pausing for a moment, taking this all in and thinking about who might be writing their story if they’re considering suicide as a way of ending their pain.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Lauren Peterson said she will attend the event because she struggled with depression and anxiety her first year at UCSB, but hesitated to seek out metal health services in fear of others thinking less of her.</p>\n<p>“Mental health stigmas prevented me from seeking help or even talking to anyone about my depression and anxiety,” Peterson said. “Once I was able to talk to others, their acceptance and drive to learn more about mental health was so relieving and helped me greatly.”</p>\n<p>Due to the sensitive nature of this event, Sims said C.A.P.S. will provide psychologists for the event.</p>\n<p>“Everyone will be impacted uniquely, and having these psychologists on the day of is a cornerstone of being selected as a school to host,” Sims said.</p>\n<p>Stanford said Send Silence Packing will serve as a “kickoff event” for UC Student Association’s upcoming mental health campaign, #HowAreYou.</p>\n<p>“Most people that are considering suicide do want to talk about it. Something as simple as ‘how are you’ can really help someone that is struggling with a mental illness,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Active Minds will host their first informational meeting on Tuesday in the SRB multipurpose room at 6 p.m. for students interested in the organization.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/send-silence-packing-to-feature-backpack-display-that-signifies-lives-lost-to-suicide/","id":2680,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2679,2678,2677],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
