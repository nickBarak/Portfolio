President Austin Hechler, however, has been the first to take action since its original proposal, and Senators Alex Giolito and Riley Hobson have authored the most recent version.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giolito credited Hechler for the work he has done to revive the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In recent history, what brought this all together was Austin Hechler and his work with the ROTC program through talking with a number of different members of it whom he worked with for this project,” Giolito said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Hechler’s outreach to ROTC, Giolito and Hobson began to draft the bill. The bill outlines problems that have existed for UCSB students in the ROTC program, such as the challenge of attending morning classes after morning workouts, managing major classes and keeping up with ROTC requirements while balancing their schedules. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This bill has garnered support from a variety of individuals, including both current and former UCSB ROTC members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill includes a letter from current ROTC Cadet Austin Amato, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, to the Academic Senate. In the letter, Amato said he supports the potential results that priority registration could bring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I had the opportunity to utilize priority registration, I would have been more competitive in ROTC, better prepared for classes and perhaps had the opportunity to further immerse myself into other activities and clubs around campus, such as the TMP [Technology Management Program] program,” he said in the letter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, the interim co-dean of undergraduate education for the College of Letters &amp; Science, said he also supports this bill. He said that with prior registration, those enrolled in the ROTC program would have fewer quarters of academic advising since they will be able to better follow their pre-approved academic schedules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This will benefit the ROTC cadets, and by reducing workload in our understaffed office, indirectly benefit all Letters &amp; Science students,” Stopple said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Senate’s approval, the bill will now be evaluated by the Academic Senate. If it passes there, it will then go into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“ROTC students are a respected portion of the student body and should certainly be rewarded by our school for their dedication and service to the ROTC program,” Hobson said. “I can’t think of any better way to do this than by making their schedules easier by allowing ROTC students to pick their classes with priority.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/bill-to-allow-priority-registration-for-rotc-cadets/","id":2405,"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher"},"related":[2404,2403,2402],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":98,"name":"Matthew Danaher","biography":"Not available","articles":[2405,3911,4440,4455,4469],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Senate Passes Resolution to Rename A.S.

Publications is a partially subsidized low-cost printing business available to UC Santa Barbara students, staff and faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller worked as assistant publications coordinator, organizing and designing course readers with professors, and helping students and professors design flyers and posters for campus organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was authored by Ashley Selki, an off-campus senator and third-year economics major, and was seconded by Batsheva Stoll, an off-campus senator and third-year history of public policy major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motion praises Miller and says he “was a good man with a wonderful work ethic who was dedicated to supporting student endeavors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selki said she decided to author the resolution in order for people struggling in “these difficult times” to have a tangible way to honor his memory and for future students to appreciate the impact that his work had on helping students at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selki said she hopes students in the future who will never have been able to meet him will take the name of the print shop as a dedication to his hard work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a wonderful man David Miller was and how much we appreciate everything that he’s done for the association.

id=\"caption-attachment-76914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The building, located between Broida Hall and the UCSB Library, has been plagued by dry rot, damage from insects and steel beam corrosion. <em>Jose Arturo Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After an inspection of the building by Van Sande Structural Consultants, campus building official Ed Schmittgen notified the university on Jan. 9 that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>Schmittgen said there was also not enough seismic bracing within the building.</p>\n<p>Seismic bracing “prevents a building from moving laterally during a seismic event,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p>Such problems could weaken the building’s structure and lead to earthquake vulnerability, he said. The university informed students that they needed to evacuate the building within 45 days.</p>\n<p>The building is over 40 years old and serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began during the week of Feb. 13 and concluded over Spring Break, the university has added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building. These structures make the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes.</p>\n<p>“We essentially have more assurance now that the building is structurally stable than prior to this effort,” Schmittgen said.</p>\n<p>The addition of the concrete pillars has decreased the seismic risk of the building and is one of the steps stabilizing the building. The building will need further adjustments to fix a rotting part of the floor and the foundation of the building, which has suffered water damage.</p>\n<p>The remaining reparations will take place over the summer so students can continue to use El Centro throughout Spring Quarter. Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said the administration is working with a group of students from El Centro to plan out the details of the project.</p>\n<p>“The seismic stabilization had to happen right away in order to keep the building in use this year, but the other part of the renovation, we’re outlining the scope of the project right now,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, pressure from the student groups that use El Centro prompted the administration to reconsider its options for the building’s future. Associated Students Senate passed a bill on Jan. 18 urging the university to preserve the historical building.</p>\n<p>“What really made the difference was students saying, ‘We don’t want the building out of commission,’” Klawunn said. “So then Design and Construction went back to see if there is any solution to this that could keep the building in operation.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the new solution was not driven by finances or the cost of a demolition project but rather by “what makes the most sense.” She said the plan allows students to access the building for the duration of the quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

And for more information to contact me at <em>r.smivsb@gmail.com</em> with the demand(s) interested in working on and a schedule,” Earvin said in her email to UC administration.</p>\n<p>Armistead said she misunderstood Earvin’s request and sent out an email advertising Tuesday’s town hall to all students.</p>\n<p>Following Earvin’s opening statement, attendees received updates on each of the 12 demands made by nowUCsb, an organization which strives to “expose and reform broken campus policies on sexual violence” according to the group’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The administration marked each demand as “incomplete,” “complete” or “in progress.” The panel then provided specific information on the progress of each demand.</p>\n<p>The first demand was to create and fund a survivor resource center in Isla Vista. According to Klawunn, the university provides legal and counseling services for survivors, despite there being no “one-stop shop” for these resources. The demand was marked as incomplete, but the panel said it was interested in looking further into the matter.</p>\n<p>The second demand, which said C.A.P.S. must provide adequate and timely mental health services to survivors and their families, was marked as in progress.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. Director Conway said the organization now has eight staff members, which she described as its largest staff ever. She said C.A.P.S. has also diversified the days and times for group counseling and activities.</p>\n<p>The third demand sought mandatory sensitivity trainings for UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol that address race, gender, class and sexuality in connection to sexual assault and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Assistant UCPD Chief Farley said UCPD and the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office attended a three-day training this August. Additionally, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/detective-joins-ivfp-following-student-protests-demands/\">IVFP hired a new detective</a>, Julio Gutierrez, to handle sexual assault and interpersonal violence in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said demand four, asking Santa Barbara City College to be more transparent about students who have been disciplined for Title IX violations, is complete.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX director Ariana Alvarez will be collaborating with the Title IX director at SBCC.</p>\n<p>The seventh demand, for survivors of sexual assault and interpersonal violence to be able to transfer to a different university, is already in practice, Klawunn said. The UC facilitates UC-to-UC transfers for survivors.</p>\n<p>Demand 10, which required integrating Queer Connect, an educational workshop that focuses on sexual assault, dating violence and stalking within LGBTQ communities, to reporting and trainings, was also implemented and officially began at the beginning of Fall Quarter, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>The remaining seven demands were marked incomplete, but members of the panel assured those in attendance they are working to meet them.</p>\n<p>Demand six ordered administration to work with the I.V. CSD to create a report card for government institutions and law enforcement agencies for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in I.V. Earvin marked that demand six has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p>The university is unable to meet demand eight for increased lighting on Slough Road because the Coastal Commission will not approve the change in infrastructure, according to Klawunn.</p>\n<p>Demand nine, to organize a meeting with all UC Chancellors on our UC Santa Barbara campus to develop system-wide level change, was not met “the way the demand is written,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>A UC-level sexual assault policy training review was held in September.</p>\n<p>Demand 11 asked the UC president to conduct yearly campus tours, where they should hold a public sexual violence town hall at every UC campus once per year.</p>\n<p>Robin Holmes-Sullivan, UC vice president for student affairs, will instead hold a town hall at UCSB on Jan. 8.</p>\n<p>Demand 12 requested Chancellor Yang and his office regularly update students about the progress being made on these demands. Klawunn said the demand was incomplete and said Tuesday’s town hall was one way to update the public.</p>\n<p>After the panel discussed their progress on each of the 12 demands, the floor became open for the approximately 30 students present to ask questions. The panel also answered anonymously submitted questions.</p>\n<p>Attendees asked why the UC administration has the funds for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/\">Halloween ads</a> but not to meet the 12 demands. Others asked whether programs like Gaucho FYI and Haven are enough to combat rape culture.</p>\n<p>The public made suggestions to the panel regarding addressing rape culture at places like the Student Leadership Retreat, where many leaders of organizations gather for training each year.</p>\n<p>They also mentioned the newly-introduced UC Title IX Student Advisory Board and asked if the students chosen to serve on this board would be compensated for the time commitment required to be on the board.</p>\n<p>Armistead agreed that students who serve on the board should be compensated.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
