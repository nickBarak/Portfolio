According to Stephany Romero, assistant director of UCSB Orientation Programs &amp; Parent Services, the change came about after she recognized the demand for the full program in Spanish and got to work recruiting department representatives for Spanish workshops.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero assembled the Orientation for Spanish-Speaking Parents Committee with colleagues from various departments, such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the College of Letters and Science, and began the task of translating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to translate a lot of the material that is already in our English orientation into Spanish and quickly find presenters from those offices to do those presentations,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quick turnaround necessary for the program, along with the task of translating, did not give the Orientation Programs office the opportunity for as much outreach to parents and students as they had hoped, Romero said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, she believes the program was still a great success this summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Considering we didn’t advertise a lot, we got a pretty good turnout,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, orientation staffers like Parent Liaison Melissa Medina were able to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents on the first day of orientation sessions to let them know of the new program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of those parents actually didn’t know there was a Spanish parent orientation program and would come hoping they would just be able to understand something off of the English one,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were so relieved when we approached them and let them know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina, a fourth-year sociology and comparative literature double major, enjoyed working directly with the Spanish-speaking parents for most of the two-day sessions, as she could personally relate to their questions and concerns for their new students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a [first-generation student] from immigrant parents, I was able to give them my experiences of what it’s like being a student in the university,” she said. “I think that really helped them feel more comfortable with their students coming.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the goals of parent orientation is to encourage students and parents to create an open line of communication about academics, Medina said. Giving Spanish-speaking parents this same opportunity is equally as important, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would give parents genuine stories of things I wish I would’ve been able to speak more to my parents about,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to college can be especially hard for first-generation students and their parents if they have no experience with universities, Medina emphasized. She said something as simple as giving Spanish-speaking parents a translated list of campus resources helps them feel more comfortable about the university their children are attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a lot of us don’t realize is the university is such a foreign space for people who haven’t experienced it, and it can seem very intimidating… I know now that if these parents have information, they’re able to support their students and be here for them, provide them with resources and answers and let them know they belong here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of the program is personal for Romero as well, who, as a first-generation alumna of UCSB, has a background similar to those of the students she helps with the Spanish parent orientations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to this school, and I was also [first-generation],” she said. “And I know that if my mom had known some of the information that we have provided to our parents now, my experience here would have been 100% different because I would have had the proper support.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero said this program will allow Spanish-speaking parents to support their students in ways that other parents have already had the opportunity to; parents now have knowledge of campus resources to be able to answer questions that students might have regarding academics because they had the opportunity to communicate with department representatives directly at orientation, according to Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it’s a major deal they get the same information the other parents are getting so that they’re as well informed,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina said she and her co-workers also received a lot of support from staff of the English-speaking program, who along with other UCSB staff were excited to see the Spanish events taking place and “would always hang around or peep into the presentation[s].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the translated material established and ready to go for future summers, the program aims to expand advertising efforts and add more department presentations to its schedule and possibly even work with the other UC campuses and their orientation programs, according to Romero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anytime I see a parent, I envision my mom and the happiness she would get to not only be given information, but to be seen as a normal human being, not just some foreign person,” Romero said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They are present, they also need help and they are also parents trying to support their child.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

But now, at the end of her second year, she does not believe that the program was made for people like her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man,” Eseka said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her experience with the Honors Program underscores an issue that has loomed over the department’s staff for years — the program’s demographic fails to reflect the diversity of students that exists in UCSB’s student body as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2018-2019 school year, UCSB boasted one of the most diverse student bodies of any college in the nation, snagging 14th place in “Best Ethnic Diversity” among public national universities by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US News &amp; World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/019172/top-five\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advertised by the university at the time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But the Honors Program told a different story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost half of the 1,713 students in the honors program in 2018-19 school year identified as white or Caucasian, despite white or Caucasian students making up only about 30% of the total student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicanx/Latinx and Black/African American populations in the Honors Program represented less than half of their respective proportions in the student body, according to numbers from UCSB’s Office of Budget &amp; Planning in the 2018-19 school year. Chicanx/Latinx students made up about 12% of the Honors Program compared to 29% of the student body; Black/African American students made up about two percent of the Honors Program compared to five percent of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-KN8eC\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of UCSB Undergraduates Campuswide vs. in the Honors Program, 2018-19\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KN8eC/3/\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Stacked Column Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of nearly 40 Black students in the program, Eseka doesn’t always see diversity at program activities, such as honor seminars, and she said the university could be doing more to support people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chance of me being the only Black person in that class is really high and sometimes maybe as an honors [student], you might get second looks, like ‘Are you in the right place?’ and you have to be like ‘Yeah, I am,’” Eseka said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Eseka, feeling comfortable in the Honors Program is key to recruiting and retaining people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Diversity is really necessary to encourage more people to come to the program and then to stay in the program, so you don’t feel lonely or feel left out or singled out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of the new honors students enrolling for the 2019-2020 school year, diversity statistics aren’t improving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the incoming group of freshmen – the class of 2023 – invited to join the Honors Program, almost half of the students are white. Chicanx, Latinx and African American students collectively make up less than 10% of the honors-eligible students. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-eoOjm\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of Incoming UCSB Freshman Admitted to the Honors Program, Fall 2019\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eoOjm/6/\" height=\"458\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education, is one person in the honors departments who has kept the issue of diversity on his radar. When he first started to look more closely at the honors department about three years ago, Stopple noted several concerns with the way the program had been functioning, particularly with how the program included and supported diverse student populations at UCSB.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a high rate of attrition, of students not staying in the program. There was also a concern that the program didn’t represent the diversity of UCSB [because] it was not particularly diverse,” Stopple said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But three years since Stopple’s arrival, the diversity of students in the program still lags behind the diversity of the campus as a whole. Stopple said his office has worked in several ways to modify the program to support students of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those efforts is the collaborative Q&amp;A panel discussion put on in May 2019 by Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the honors department. Over a hundred first-year students who were on track to meet the honors requirements were invited to attend the information panel to hear from current EOP honors students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said the panel, which he started in 2017, has been effective in recruiting more diverse students to the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eseka spoke alongside Stella Delgado, a UCSB third-year history of public policy and anthropology double major, as panelists during the event. The two discussed EOP students’ concerns about the “intimidation” factor of the Honors Program. Some students felt the “elitist” reputation of the Honors Program was something that gave them reservations about applying, Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Delgado, the program’s lack of diversity points to “the different challenges students of color face on campus and the different challenges students from lower-income communities also face.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a student of color and a low-income student, I’ve had to maintain having a job for most of my time at UCSB, which has taken away from academics,” Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can enter the program in two ways: by being invited into the Honors Program when admitted to the university or by applying to the program the summer after their freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising sophomores are required to adhere to a 3.5 GPA and 36 letter-graded units requirement to enter the program, Stopple said.  Students can apply for the program in July and are admitted so long as they meet the GPA and unit requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said GPA is a “crude” metric and that he “would prefer to do something different.” But for now, due to “limited resources,” the honors department cannot incorporate more criteria for their application process besides the “purely quantitative” measures currently in place, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple did, however, lower the GPA requirement for the honors program from 3.6 to 3.5 in June 2017 in order to include more students in the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several advantages that come with being in the Honors Program; one, Stopple said, is having priority enrollment, which allows honors students to be among the first to enroll in classes during pass times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other advantages that come with being in the Honors Program include access to special academic advising, extended library privileges and academic and community service opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The promise of one-on-one time with professors, building relationships for letters of recommendations and beefing up resumes with honors status draws many students to the program. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michelle McKee, a recent graduate of the Honors Program, said “it’s very hard to get one-on-one time with the professors and to really talk with and work with the professors” without having the advantages of the Honors Program.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She joined the Honors Program after her freshman year and said the perks benefitted her education at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The day-one pass time is a plus,” she said. “But I also just knew that there were a lot of great opportunities if you were involved in the Honors Program including these really cool honors seminars and I’ve just been able to take so many interesting classes that I wouldn’t have taken otherwise.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB honors student, Michael Stallworth, said his experience in the Honors Program helped him get settled into the university and allowed him to “work with other people who are like-minded and just want to… achieve as much as they can.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth noted that a diverse honors program would indicate a university that adequately supports students of color and students from unique backgrounds, something still in the works at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just shows that we have people from different communities who are able to be successful at UCSB and still be able to take advantage of the opportunities that are offered,” Stallworth said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the experience of each student in the Honors Program varies, many agree that increasing and supporting diverse populations in the program remains an important goal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know how much more opportunities and advantages I get being in the Honors Program between volunteer opportunities, earlier pass times, separate advisors,” said Zeina Safadi, an honors fourth-year political science major. “And so it would be disheartening to think that it was only to a specific group of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Eseka said the root of the problem is in the way minority students perceive the Honors Program, and given the unique challenges they already face at UCSB, honors could be exactly what these students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You hear honors [and] you think ‘I’m not meant for this,’ not because you don’t have the credentials, but just because… historically, as a low-income first generation minority, you’ve…  had so many barriers that have prevented you from getting here faster or at the same pace as others.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Eseka, the Honors Program makes achieving her academic and career goals a little bit easier. The distinction of being in the Honors Program in college is an edge that she said she needs to accomplish her goals after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s one reason why I keep on going because I know I’m gonna hit so many barriers. It’s just gonna make it one less hoop.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

We thought Parkland would be the last one. But here we are again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over fifty members of the Santa Barbara community <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-08/in-photos-santa-barbara-mourns-victims-of-gilroy-el-paso-and-dayton-mass-shootings/\">convened downtown last Monday evening</a> to mourn those who were killed in the mass shootings in Dayton, El Paso and Gilroy. Thirty six died and nearly one hundred were injured across the three mass shootings, which all happened within the span of a week.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gathering was organized over Facebook by Armbruster-Sandoval and Amanda Pinheiro, a graduate student in the UCSB Global Studies department, less than 24 hours earlier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcus Lopez, a local activist and Chumash native, opened the vigil with a blessing and performed a native healing song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees were invited to step forward and speak their minds. Most messages centered around community and a common humanity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that power is found in the community,” one attendee said. “We must stand together as a community. It is the answer. We must demand from politicians the responsibility to act. When we get there, we’ll be back as humans together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are no agendas here tonight other than the human agenda,” another gatherer said, alluding to the political nature of the debate that has sparked across the country in response to the three shootings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emiliano Campobello </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a UCSB alumnus, local activist, co-chair of Santa Barbara Standing Rock Coalition and co-founder of The Climate Mobilization’s Santa Barbara County chapter </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> condemned the racist motivations of the El Paso shooter who opened fire at a crowded Walmart. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shooter admitted to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/us/el-paso-suspect-confession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“targeting Mexicans”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and, in his manifesto, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/politics/trump-mass-shootings.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the “attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Donald Trump, who has </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/11/business/media/el-paso-killer-conservative-media.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referred to the northern migration of asylum seekers from Latin America as an “invasion,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been criticized this week for similarities between his words and those of the shooter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House right now is really disturbing,” Campobello said. “Now, are we going to have to be afraid to be brown and go to Walmart?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campobello, who is also a professional muralist, musician and descendent of the Yaqui and Huichol tribes, performed a song on the Native American flute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Music gets past the mind,” he said. “Language kind of gets stuck, even if the words have certain meanings. Music and melodies… get into the heart space. And as that space can open up, we can tap into a field of love. And that is what we really need right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others reflected on their hope for future action to prevent such tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think hope is sometimes the only thing that we have to hold on to,” said one attendee. “But it is powerful. Because hope can lead to action. If we all put in our little piece of work, we can transform our communities, we can transform our state, we can transform our country. You each have a lot of power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see an awakening,” said Campobello. “People are less able to remain complacent and are being called to action because things have been so bad. That’s where I see hope.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89519\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89519\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/","id":2014,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[2013,2012,2011],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
