The nonprofit focuses on providing parent education, low-cost childcare and preparing children to start school.</p>\n<p>Narrowly clearing its Dec. 31 fundraising deadline, IVYP completed its “$300K for $300K Match Campaign,” through a crowdfunding page, which indicated $300,033 raised on the morning of Jan. 1.</p>\n<p>Speaking about the success of the fundraiser, IVYP executive director LuAnn Miller said the “community-based campaign” had donations ranging from a penny to thousands of dollars from local foundations.</p>\n<p>The funds qualify the organization for the County of Santa Barbara’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), which has awarded IVYP an additional $300,000. IVYP intends to use the $600,000 to purchase the building it currently rents near the Camino Real Marketplace, closing out a mortgage of $1.2 million.</p>\n<p>“The CDBG grant from the County of Santa Barbara comprises the final payment of the mortgage, and it really was an ‘all or nothing’ … We needed to get the mortgage gap down to $300,000,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>The County of Santa Barbara reviews and selects grant recipients with a committee of 13 members organized by the Santa Barbara City Council. The committee, referred to as the Community Development and Human Services Committee (CDHSC), consists of representatives from several local groups.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74750\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74750\" data-attachment-id=\"74750\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/childrens-center-benefits-from-new-funds/ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ivyp-by-jose-ochoa-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74750\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IVYP-by-Jose-Ochoa-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"LuAnn Miller, Executive Director of IVYP, personally raised $12,230 for IVYP's capital campaign last year.

Waterproof awnings have also been installed in order to protect some of the children’s equipment.</p>\n<p>According to Miller, future renovation plans include extending the tricycle path in the outdoor area, replacing a washing machine and kitchen stove and providing more natural spaces for the children to play in. In order to create more natural areas while remaining environmentally conscious, IVYP hopes to plant a succulent garden.</p>\n<p>In line with its commitment to sustainability, the center ultimately intends to install solar panels in order to curtail their energy costs. Miller said this is a way for them to use the money they save to create more programs and give back to their community.</p>\n<p>Miller said the local community’s support was critical to the fundraiser’s success.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t have done it without the grassroots support of Isla Vista and Goleta communities,” she said. “It was the families baking cookies and doing jog-a-thons and selling raffle baskets and taco carts and penny drives … It was amazing to see the community pull together.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors has already awarded IVYP a Community Development Block Grant, and is now finalizing the release of funds. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

work makes the UC work” and “Pay workers enough to live in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>Union members across the state surrounded medical centers at UCLA, UCSD and UCSF. UCLA skilled trade union members were on strike for five days in protest of their low wages, marching into Westwood on Tuesday and temporarily blocking traffic.</p>\n<p>A 2015 Economic Policy Institute survey reported 92 percent of California union workers struggle to provide for themselves or their families.</p>\n<p>The UC employees’ contract expired in November and representatives from each campus have been meeting with university administration to negotiate a new contract since April, but an agreement is yet to be reached.</p>\n<p>UC has proposed an 18 percent pay increase over the next six years, but union members are saying the increase is not substantial. Furthermore, a UC spokesperson said in October that the UC “heavily subsidizes the cost of healthcare for our workers,” with those in lower paid positions contributing “as little as $47 a month for health benefits for their entire family.” The UC additionally offers a pension program with guaranteed payments on retirement.</p>\n<p>Dissenters have called the strike unlawful, but Debbie Fingerle, chief steward of UCSB Teamsters, said the stalled contract negotiations have left employees working without a contract, so the no-strike clause does not apply.</p>\n<p>“They will not negotiate in good faith,” Jedediah Johnson, office manager of the Teamsters Local 186 of Ventura, said. “We need to be at the table … and we need to learn about the cost of living and how much it actually cost with food, families [and] regulations.”</p>\n<p>Food security is another concern of the union as they battle for higher wages. According to a 2016 survey done by Teamsters Local 2010 and Occidental College, 70 percent of clerical workers struggle to buy food and 45 percent are “food insecure” and often skip meals due to a lack of resources. The survey was sent to 13,661 UC employees, and their median wage was reported to be $22.65 per hour.</p>\n<p>Brian Harwell, union member and the undergraduate advisor for the Department of Theater and Dance, said he is concerned about employees who struggle to provide food for themselves and their families.</p>\n<p>“In a higher education environment that is expensive, where you have really high pay for certain people in the university, it just seems petty and brutal,” Harwell said.</p>\n<p>Harwell said clerical employees provide a “significant role” on UC campuses, and he wants the strike to encourage understanding of the work they provide for the university.</p>\n<p>“We’re classified as clerical, but there are certain people that run the department,” Harwell said. “We have our hands in all the nuts and bolts.”</p>\n<p>Union workers hope Tuesday’s demonstration will pressure the UC to reach a contract with the employees that fulfills their demands. According to Fingerle, the union members are close to the results they want and “just need to push a little bit further” for their wage increases.</p>\n<p>“[The university is] very slow in responding, which is part of the reason we’re striking,” Fingerle said. “On a whole, they do come back with something, but it’s just not enough, and they have what we need.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting two weeks ago to oppose the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>Professors suggested creating a list of “sanctuary” faculty members who are available to support students who are distressed. The idea is modeled after the “sanctuary campus,” a symbolic designation with special powers.</p>\n<p>Sanctuary campuses can protect students from deportation, certain federal immigration laws and other threats, similar to sanctuary cities. The movement has emerged at Tufts, Rutgers, Yale, Stanford and several other universities after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, followed by multiple protests throughout the country.</p>\n<p>At an A.S. Senate meeting Tuesday, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez presented an alternative for students who didn’t wish to contribute to the College Republicans event.</p>\n<p>The Compulsory Fee Refund Application allows students to withdraw their portion of student funding from specific programs and is a product of a 1993 California Supreme Court Decision: Smith v. Regents.</p>\n<p>The court ruled in 1993 that the UC cannot force students to pay for events that pursue political or ideological goals through “compulsion and coercion.”</p>\n<p>“This specific ruling was obviously brought up at this specific meeting because one of the administrators who has a lot of ties with a lot of these left-leaning organizations,” Andrew Gates, College Republicans president, told the Nexus during the Senate meeting Wednesday, adding that the ruling could work against “left-leaning” events.</p>\n<p>“We have, what, one event per quarter? But if you divide 5,000 by 23,000 students … compare that with the countless left-leaning events that you know all the conservative students could, like, get a refund for,” he said.</p>\n<p>At the faculty meeting one hour prior, Sanchez quoted comments from the College Republican’s YouTube video of the Nov. 3 Senate meeting. The comments can only be removed by the owner of the account, or YouTube if the comments are reported.</p>\n<p>“Lets get these cunts. Comment a link to the BLM fascists facebook page, I’ll trigger these scumbags,” one comment reads.</p>\n<p>“Dis what fatherless iq 85 african americans been taught by iq 130 jews who think whites nazist. ethnic weapons,” read another comment on a repost of the video, which College Republicans cannot regulate. Ladijah Corder, co-chair of UCSB Black Student Union, later recited the same comment to the Senate during public forum.</p>\n<p>Tamara Afifi, professor of communication, said while advocacy may interrupt scholarly work, it is the responsibility of non-minorities to support activists. “It’s up to us,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of white people are scared to say something stupid; they’re scared to be vulnerable,” she said. “It’s not up to people of color to educate them, they have enough placed on them.”</p>\n<p>Armistead, who has been a vocal advocate of students who are against the College Republicans program, said “We need to take our campus back.”</p>\n<p>“I’m upset, too,” Armistead said. “It kills me because I’m the one who ultimately has to make this event successful.”</p>\n<p>Other faculty members built a suggestion list, including attending the event en masse to occupy seats and arguing with Ben Shapiro point by point during his lecture.</p>\n<p>Demetrius Ous, a UCSB graduate student, suggested planning counter events at the same time of the College Republicans events.</p>\n<p>“The point of these events is expressing joy and love for one another,” he said. “If you see hatred, you should show it a smile because hatred is going on.”</p>\n<p>The conversation culminated with an initial push to create buttons for faculty to wear during the event. The buttons would be emblems of inclusivity, saying “UCSB Against Hate.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: The second comment was shared on a repost of the College Republicans’ video, not on the College Republicans account.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74307\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74307\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/faculty-join-free-speech-dialogue/","id":2440,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2439,2438,2437],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
