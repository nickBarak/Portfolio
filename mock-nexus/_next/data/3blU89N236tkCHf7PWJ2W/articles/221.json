The Redhawks recorded a 58-53 victory over the Gauchos last season.</p>\n<p>An interesting aspect of Friday’s matchup between Santa Barbara and Seattle is that redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar used to play for Seattle prior to transferring to UCSB last season.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Redhawks, Sahar averaged 10.2 points as a freshman while also shooting 38 percent from a three-point range.<br>\nSahar, who sat out last year due to NCAA transfer rules, has brought the Gauchos an increased shooting ability and length on the perimeter.</p>\n<p>In spite of the intangibles she possesses, Sahar hasn’t had much of an impact in the team’s two games.</p>\n<p>She has yet to score a point and has gone 0-for-3 from the field and 0-2 from behind the three-point line in each contest.</p>\n<p>While Sahar has slowed down considerably in terms of production following 14 points in her debut in the Gauchos’ exhibition win over CSU East Bay, the 5’11” guard is understandably getting accustomed after not playing a single game last season.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Sahar will get into more of a rhythm facing her old team.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, its turnover woes have continued.</p>\n<p>While it is early in the season and the team will likely tighten up its offense as it develops more chemistry, the Gauchos turned the ball over 21 times Tuesday night against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>Many of these turnovers can be attributed to Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson’s decision to start two true freshmen, Danae Miller and Sarah Bates, and Santa Clara managed to take advantage of the young guards’ inexperience at the collegiate level.</p>\n<p>While redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman scored a game-high 23 points on 50 percent shooting, the Gauchos will need to get more contributions from their role players if they wish to win games this season.</p>\n<p>One player the Gauchos are hoping will emerge soon is redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter.</p>\n<p>In the team’s first two games, she shot a combined 8-for-19 from the field and has really been missed from beyond the arc, where she has gone 4-for-12. Notably, after playing 32 minutes in UCSB’s season opener, Porter only played 15 minutes in the team’s loss to Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>No other Gaucho reached double-digit scoring versus Santa Clara, allowing defenses to focus primarily on containing Edelman in the post.</p>\n<p>UCSB definitely has the talent to disrupt defenses, with plenty of shooting ability, but perhaps Henrickson will have to stress ball movement to find open shots on kick-outs from Edelman.<br>\nSanta Barbara has so far shot 45.7 percent from downtown this season, so it seems it will only be a matter of getting more opportunities from three-point land in order to generate offense.</p>\n<p>Facing Seattle may be the remedy the Gauchos are looking for, as the Redhawks have allowed opponents to score at least 73 points in both of their losses.</p>\n<p>Seattle is coming off a season in which it went 15-18 overall and 10-4 in Western Athletic Conference (WAC) play.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks finished tied for second in the WAC and made it to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament, where they lost their first-round game to Wyoming.</p>\n<p>In her second season, Seattle Head Coach Suzy Barcomb is looking to improve even in the face of losing three of her starters from last season.</p>\n<p>Barcomb seems to have the experience and knowledge to make her capable of leading this year’s Seattle team back into postseason play.<br>\nIn her total 18 seasons of coaching, Barcomb has a win percentage of .640, holding a record of 320-180 overall.</p>\n<p>Increasing the likelihood of sustaining such success definitely becomes more plausible with a player like Alexis Montgomery.</p>\n<p>The redshirt senior two-guard is currently the team’s leading scorer at 23.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Also making an impact is the reigning WAC Freshman of the Year recipient, sophomore guard Kamira Sanders, whose 13.5 PPG ranks second on the team.<br>\nFriday’s home opener will tip off at 7 p.m. on Nov. 17 at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Many of the matches were close, but the Gauchos fell short nearly every time, with four of the six singles matches decided by a third set tiebreak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been plagued with injuries so far this season, and as a result, have been shifting their starting lineup quite frequently. The Gauchos have had three different starters at the first singles position thus far, and have really been trying to find their strongest lineup. However, in the case of this weekend’s match against UC Irvine, UCSB looks to be the healthiest it has been all season long with players returning to the court from injuries.</p>\n<p>Irvine has had a decent season for being ranked No. 42 by the NCAA. They have defeated strong opponents in San Diego State 4-0, and Cal State Fullerton 4-3, but have been blown out by No. 30 ranked TCU 4-0 and were outmatched by No. 44 Pepperdine 6-1. In their last match against No. 9 USC, the Anteaters were swept 7-0.</p>\n<p>Starting at number one singles for UC Irvine is Marivick Mamiit who fell to USC’s Brynn Boren 3-6, 2-6. The Anteaters have indeed had a tough schedule, but have dropped matches to teams who they were projected to defeat or who were of lesser rank. If the Gauchos arrive ready to win and get themselves in an early match lead against UC Irvine, then UCSB has a high chance of retrieving the win and the upset on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Another factor contributing to the Gauchos is the change of scoring rules against conference opponents. The NCAA had been working out a trial run of new scoring to make non-conference games shorter. In all of UCSB’s matches up to this point, there has been no complete third set, but rather a tiebreak to determine a winner if the first two sets have been split. This has been received with great disdain by the UCSB players, because instead of a match being determined by skill, it becomes more of a toss-up of who can reach 10 points in the tiebreak first.</p>\n<p>“Irvine will definitely be tough,” senior Kiersten Meehan said. “They are one of the toughest teams in the conference, but it will be great to go back to old scoring. I think we are a very fit team, so having the old scoring back will definitely work in our favor.”</p>\n<p>The match is set to begin this Saturday at 11 a.m. at the UC Irvine tennis courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54105\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54105\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-look-to-turn-season-around-against-irvine/","id":219,"author":{"id":289,"name":"Ryan Prete"},"related":[218,217,216],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Squander 21-point Lead at Home, Fall to Seattle","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-16-at-4.05.13-AM.png?resize=679%2C405&ssl=1","description":"It was a rough ending for the UCSB women's basketball team as the Gauchos fell to Seattle University in their home opener.

It’s not a can do it’s a want to. We’ve got to develop discipline on the offensive end and toughness and discipline on the defensive end.

The Redhawks earned their first win of the season against Santa Barbara, so they sit at 1-2 as well.</p>\n<p>Redshirt senior Drew Edelman led Santa Barbara with 16 points and 19 rebounds. Senior forward Chaya Durr added 12 points and eight boards while fellow redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter added 13 and seven boards. Freshman guard Sarah Bates contributed 11 points while freshman guard Danae Miller recorded a team-high four assists.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had a rough night finding the net, shooting 39.4 percent from the field and just 28.6 percent from beyond the arc. Tal Sahar, the redshirt sophomore who played for Seattle two years ago, only played five minutes, going 0-3 with one steal.</p>\n<p>Seattle was led by Alexis Montgomery, a redshirt senior, who ended the game with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Sophomore guard Kamira Sanders contributed a bit of everything for the Redhawks, scoring 21 points to go along with 9 boards, 6 assists and 4 steals.</p>\n<p>On the night, Seattle actually shot better from beyond the arc than overall. Converting on 10-24 threes and 27-65 shots overall, the Redhawks shot 41.7 and 41.5 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Both teams appeared evenly matched in the first quarter, with the quarter ending 14-14.</p>\n<p>After a back and forth first quarter, which was hardly impressive for either team, Santa Barbara went on a run in the second to take a 23-18 lead and forced a Seattle timeout with 5:46 remaining.</p>\n<p>Out of the timeout, the Gauchos maintained their momentum. Porter contributed 10 of her 13 points in the second quarter. With the Redhawks shooting only 25 percent from the field in the quarter, the Gauchos were able to end the half with a slight edge at a 36-24 lead.</p>\n<p>UCSB opened the second half with energy and looked to be in control.</p>\n<p>With 5:39 to go in the third, the Gauchos used a Bates three to go up 51-30, leading by their largest margin of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, it gave up a 15-9 Seattle run to end the quarter. The Redhawks used big scoring from Montgomery and a handful of three-pointers for their 21-point quarter. While Seattle remained down 15 heading into the fourth, Santa Barbara appeared to have gotten too comfortable with its lead.</p>\n<p>In the final quarter, Seattle made a huge comeback, shocking the home crowd.</p>\n<p>Seattle held the Gauchos to an abysmal 5-for-20 shooting and only 1-for-6 performance from beyond the arc in the quarter.</p>\n<p>Freshmen guards Cece Quintino, Bates and Miller each faced heavy pressure from the Seattle defense, led primarily by the pestering defense of McKenzie Williams. Williams seemed to have the young guards’ numbers in the fourth, making it a hard task for Santa Barbara to simply get the ball across half court at times.</p>\n<p>The Redhawks finally got their offense rolling in the fourth, using a big quarter from Kamira Sanders. Sanders had 13 points on 5-for-5 shooting to go with 6 rebounds, 2 assists and a steal in the fourth quarter alone.</p>\n<p>Shooting 62.5 percent from three helped the Redhawks overcome the deficit, making 5-of-8 shots from beyond the arc. Fans watched in disbelief as the Gauchos squandered their 21-point lead and Seattle came storming back. While the Gauchos were held to 11 points in the quarter, Seattle put up 32.</p>\n<p>After a few back and forth possessions of Seattle chipping away at Santa Barbara’s lead, it looked like UCSB had a chance to regain its composure.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos brought the ball up the floor with 2:56 remaining, up 71-70. Santa Barbara got the ball inside to Edelman on a nice feed that gave the forward a clean look, but the 6’4 forward could not convert.</p>\n<p>Frustration seemed to kick in for the Gauchos, as missed shots and an unanswered 7-0 run by Seattle pushed Santa Barbara into desperation mode. The Gauchos ended the game with three possessions each ending in badly-missed three-point shots, and Seattle made enough of its free-throws to close out the game.</p>\n<p>Scoreless in the final 2:56, the Gauchos fell to the Redhawks 77-71.</p>\n<p>Luckily for UCSB, it will have a week break to perhaps solidify its defense and work on running its offense the way Coach Henrickson wants. UCSB will travel to Moraga, CA for the Saint Mary’s Tournament, which will begin this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-20/gauchos-squander-21-point-lead-at-home-fall-to-seattle/","id":218,"author":{"id":43,"name":"Calvin Thrift"},"related":[217,216,215],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
