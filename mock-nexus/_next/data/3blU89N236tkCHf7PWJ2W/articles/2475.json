There are currently only 11 students enrolled in the course, with a remaining 29 spots available for any Star Wars fans looking to deepen their understanding of the galactic saga.</p>\n<p>Film and media studies lecturer Cynthia Felando is offering the course during Summer Session A on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12 p.m. to 2:50 p.m. in Pollock Theater.</p>\n<p>Although it’s been nearly 40 years since the original “Star Wars” was released, Felando said the movies continue to shape the film industry. During the course, she will examine George Lucas’s creative process in development of the Star Wars films as well as the blockbuster’s success.</p>\n<p>“By looking at all of the entries in the franchise, it enables us to consider not only the emergence but also the development of the blockbuster,” Felando said in an email. “And it enables careful attention to the development of George Lucas as an ‘auteur’… and to the ways in which he brought his love and knowledge of movie history, the sci-fi genre, and other popular culture forms to bear on the first and subsequent films.”</p>\n<p>Felando said she loves Star Wars because of the scope of the film’s stories and the depth of their characterizations.</p>\n<p>“I’ve taught the original Star Wars as part of a class that considers filmmaking in the 1970s, and it just wasn’t enough Star Wars for me!” Felando said in an email. “It’s a fascinating subject because the <em>Star Wars</em> films tell a truly epic tale on an epic scale, not only about Luke and his cohorts and enemies, but also about film history and the blockbuster.”</p>\n<p>Angelo Molina, a UCSB alumnus and former co-president of Jedi Gauchos, said the course would satisfy both fans and nonfans alike, giving them the opportunity to learn about a franchise that has returned to popularity after the December release of “The Force Awakens.”</p>\n<p>“I have actually read a few books on how the franchise began. George Lucas made his life around film,” Molina said. “One person started from almost nothing and built it into what it is now: one of the most recognized franchises in the world.”</p>\n<p>Joe Palladino, the film and media studies academic advisor, sees the Star Wars films as a reflection of business, art and several other aspects of modern culture.</p>\n<p>“You would see the films in Pollock Theater, so it’s going to look and sound just great,” Palladino said. “We just did ‘The Force Awakens’ in December on Sunday with the editor and it looked really nice.”</p>\n<p>Megan Deffenbaugh, first-year communication and media studies major and self-proclaimed Star Wars fan, said the films were a family tradition while she was growing up and she now gets to experience a digitally “revitalized” version of the series.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of been passed down, therefore I loved it as a kid. I have a poster from when I was 5 years old,” Deffenbaugh said. “It brings together all generations on a common ground.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/summer-star-wars-course-summons-new-padawans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/summer-star-wars-course-summons-new-padawans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/summer-star-wars-course-summons-new-padawans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/summer-star-wars-course-summons-new-padawans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/summer-star-wars-course-summons-new-padawans/","id":2475,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2474,2473,2472],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro","biography":"Not available","articles":[2382,2386,2475,2567,2730,2735,2797,2823,2909,2948,2981,2990,3586,3605,3870,3895,3915,4407,4654,4682,4799],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Umail Phishing Scam Compromises Student, Admin Security","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-07-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Oct_22_Library_TonyUng3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Oct_22_Library_TonyUng3.jpg?resize=980%2C640&ssl=1","description":"UCSB cyber security officials talk safety after scammers sent suspicious emails to UCSB students and administration \"phishing\" for login info.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Alejandra Sanchez opened an email from UCSB last week, she noticed something wasn’t quite right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looked suspicious because it was a blank email with a small link on it from an unfamiliar name,” the fourth-year psychology major said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon seeing a surprising lack of contact information for the university, which is usually found on university notices, Sanchez deleted the email.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez, along with many UCSB students, received a fake email last week to her umail account from a source claiming to be from the university, warning that her email was restricted and required verification to be accessed. The students were urged to click on a provided link, which would send them to a website where they could type their username and password to retrieve their email account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers are reaching UCSB email accounts through “phishing,” a multi-billion-dollar underground illegal business in which scammers send forged emails to a pool of email users and wait for users to respond to the message. While Sanchez did not respond to the “phishing” bait, many students did, releasing their usernames and passwords and allowing their accounts to be used in other phishing attempts by scammers.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, a similar email was sent to UCSB staff, and 16 members released their login information to the dangerous site. These unsecure emails are not the first of their kind and pose a variety of threats to email users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once scammers have a username and login, they could use it as a gateway to access other accounts or look into students’ academic and personal records.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief information security officer, phishing is “very common and fairly easy to do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are bad guys in the world,” Horowitz said. “This is kind of the nature of what email and criminal … activity look like today.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing is common in many countries, including those formerly part of the Eastern Block and some unexpected countries such as Germany and the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of former Soviet countries are places we see hotbeds of activity,” said Joe McClain, the director of student systems I.T. infrastructure, security &amp; user support of UCSB’s Student Systems and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, China is on the list; there’s a lot of stuff happening in China, but there’re also countries you would never expect that would show up on the radar.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said unsecure emails are becoming more “sophisticated” to look like emails sent from legitimate organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When spammers go phishing, they are throwing a lure out there to see how many people bite on it,” McClain said. The more refined the email, the more likely people will trust it and release personal information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spammers are not only interested in accessing singular email addresses, but look for addresses that are trusted and widely used, like the umail server. The level of this spam only appears to be rising. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said there are “hundreds of thousands” of spam emails sent to the university’s many departments daily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s getting worse because it works … they can throw a message out there, and people click the link and give out their usernames and passwords,” McClain said. “If people didn’t do it, it wouldn’t be worthwhile.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is always making improvements to the security systems in each department, but McClain notes in some cases it is easier to secure administration and business department emails on campus than academic departments.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The faculty typically wants things to be wide open, they want to be able to whatever they want to do … and the faculty have tremendous weight on campus,” McClain said. “So there are only so many things we can do to provide controls on systems used on the academic research side.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horowitz sent an email to students Friday in response to the phishing attacks with suggestions about how to avoid getting trapped in a phishing attempt, such as being aware of who the email is coming from or what the email looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also advised students to be “skeptical” of messages that seem “too good to be true, the consequences [are] too dire [or there’s a] sense of urgency.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, Sanchez and many other students refrained from giving their login information to the unsecure email sent last week. Horowitz said he hopes that with increased education about the danger of these phishing emails, fewer students and faculty will even consider opening the illicit messages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important thing, [and] it needs to be dealt with,” he said. “This stuff happens, and you need to protect yourself.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/","id":2472,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2471,2470,2469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Danny DeVito To Promote Bernie Sanders Tuesday in The Arbor","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?resize=645%2C366&ssl=1","description":"Actor and director Danny DeVito will be at UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday afternoon, encouraging students to vote for Bernie Sanders in the California Democratic primary.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_71048\" style=\"width: 609px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71048\" data-attachment-id=\"71048\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/danny-devito-to-promote-bernie-sanders-tuesday-in-the-arbor/us-vote-democrats-politics/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?fit=645%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"645,366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bernie Sanders Danny Devito\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?fit=250%2C142&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?fit=645%2C366&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71048\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DEVITO-MARCH-ST.-LOUIS-THE-HILL.jpg?resize=599%2C340\" alt=\"Danny DeVito endorsed Bernie Sanders at a St. Louis rally in March.
