Yaeger has written several books about beer and is featured regularly in publications including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All About Beer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer Advocate</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and appeared on NPR’s Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[My love for beer] began back in my college career, and I just think that the craft beer industry and the beer styles that are available have matured,” Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just seems like the right time for the university to match the wine tasting class with the beer education class.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger was inspired to create such a class after he took a wine tasting class, also offered through the Rec Cen, when he was an undergraduate. He approached UCSB about teaching a class about beer last year, aiming to create one that would be on par with the wine class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took [the wine class] and I loved it, but personally I’ve just always been more of a beer drinker and a beer fan,” he said. “And all of the beer knowledge that I have amassed, I had to sort of undergo that research by myself, but it would have been great if I could have had a course like this myself to set me on the right path.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaerger, who is also verified on Twitter and is the author of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red, White, and Brew: An American Beer Odyssey,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> described his class as a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“way for people to really get their toes wet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you are a student… let’s just go with the premise that your alcoholic beverage consumption begins at 21 – we could put a little winky face in there. Any consumption that you may have experienced is more than likely enjoyed a very gregarious setting where the aim is to be social and not really thinking about the beverage,” he said, laughing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger explained that college drinking culture doesn’t necessarily foster active thinking about the beverage or its enjoyment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, when you’re playing beer pong or quarters or any of those games, you’re not really thinking about how much you enjoy a drink, or what it’s made from. You just know it’s wet, it’s cold and it’s gonna have an impact.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class is open to both students and the surrounding Goleta and Santa Barbara community for $90 for students and $95 for non-students but attendees must be 21 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class will interweave the history of beer with a series of tastings, which are arranged by country and region. For example, the first night will feature German or Continential Loggers, while the second will feature British ales, Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By the end, if you go to the supermarket or a bottle shop, and you see all the different brands in front of you, it’s not going to be strange and sort of foreign. You’re going to understand what those offerings are,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, attendees will taste close to 40 different kinds of beer and should bring at least two wine glasses or tasting chalices, as well as “palate cleansers” such as pretzels, bread, crackers and, of course, lots of water. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students must sign up at the Rec Cen Customer Service Center. Online sign-ups are not available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t have to love every beer I’m going to pour, but you have to understand that someone loves it. And that every person who takes this class is going to leave with a broader understanding and a passion for these styles that they just didn’t even know existed before,” Yaeger said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-76566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I think it was a positive experience overall,” Kristen LaBonte, a Life and Environmental Sciences Librarian representing UCSB at the bargaining table, said in an interview with the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>“We worked diligently to come up with language that was equitable and we were working around issues that were pre-existing and known to the union because of grievances that had been filed relating to our current contract and now former contracts.”</p>\n<p>One of these grievances revolved around salaries.</p>\n<p>LaBonte said that many librarians felt their salaries from UCSB were inadequate when considering the high cost of living in Santa Barbara. LaBonte even thinks that some librarian job applicants ruled out UCSB as a viable option because of this inadequacy.</p>\n<p>“We’d hear feedback from people that would say, ‘well, I didn’t realize what the cost of living was like,’” said LaBonte, who took a 22% pay cut after coming to UCSB from her previous position as a librarian at California State University Channel Islands.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to attract people just because of the location, which is beautiful and amazing,” she added. “But if you don’t have the salaries to match it, people either won’t come or they won’t stick around for long.”</p>\n<p>To remedy this situation, the union reached a deal with UC that would guarantee an “annual increases for all represented librarians, with a total cumulative benefit of approximately 22-26% over five years,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians, another debated grievance, played a large role throughout the contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians are librarians who are only hired to work a set duration of time at their respective place of employment.</p>\n<p>Coinciding with an already high employee turnover, LaBonte said that she and other library representatives worked with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to improve the conditions of temporary librarians.</p>\n<p>Although the situation with temporary librarians was not completely resolved, the union, along with input from UCOP, was able to partially amend their new contract to prevent future abuses from UC libraries, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>“We tried our best to get some wording in for the issue with temporary librarians. UC occasionally hires temporary librarians and the contract says that it’s not supposed to be for permanent work,” LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>“When that person leaves, who is going to fill in the gap?” LaBonte raised about the issue.</p>\n<p>When a temporary librarian leaves, another one is hired to replace them. This process oftentimes repeats itself multiple times, depleting the library of resources used to rehire and train new librarians, LaBonte added.</p>\n<p>Similar to temporary librarians, academic freedom among UC librarians saw improvement, but was ultimately left out of the new contract. Academic freedom, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/position/academic-freedom\">union’s website</a>, “is based on the idea that the free exchange of ideas on campus is essential to good education.”</p>\n<p>After introducing academic freedom during the bargaining process, LaBonte said that UC immediately dismissed it, reasoning that academic freedom would not be a “good fit” in the contract.</p>\n<p>“That news rippled far and wide. I was hearing from colleagues all over the country that they had heard what was going on here. So that was also some bad publicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>Although academic freedom was left unincorporated in the new contract, Labonte claims that she and fellow union representatives reached a deal with academic freedom.</p>\n<p>“We did get [UC] to verbally agree that they would be incorporating the academic freedom policy protections,” she said, emphasizing that the inclusion of a verbal agreement was paramount, as “basically all of the academics on campus did not have academic freedom protection” until this new policy takes effect.</p>\n<p>However, in order for the academic freedom policy to go into action, it will still have to undergo a 90 day system-wide review, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Another component of the new contract was professional development. Although funding for librarians at UCSB is distributed on a per-capita (campus) basis, this was not a uniform practice, according to LaBonte. Other UC libraries distribute money on a first come, first serve basis, which she deems is an unfair practice to UC librarians.</p>\n<p>With the new contract, however, all UC libraries will operate on a per-capita basis, ensuring a fair and equal amount of funding is available to each library.</p>\n<p>LaBonte stressed the importance of this new practice, adding that this funding allows librarians “to go and present at conferences and participate with professional organizations.”</p>\n<p>Other small victories were piled into the contract as well, LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>For example, if a librarian falls ill during a vacation, they can opt to use sick leave instead of their vacation time. Also, librarians are now guaranteed up to thirty days of sick leave which can be used for “baby bonding”, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some demands did not get any ink in this cycle’s contract, and librarians will have to wait until the next round of contract negotiations for further demands to be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>Sabbaticals and eligibility for housing assistance programs, for example, were left unsupported by the new contract, as well as “grievability for denials of flexible work arrangements,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Overall, the union deemed this contract a success, highlighted by a post on their website: “This is not an April Fools joke! UCOP has been notified; the new MOU is officially in effect.”</p>\n<p>LaBonte emulated a similar sentiment, notably her enthusiasm for an overwhelming number of wins in this cycle of negotiations.</p>\n<p>When asked why she wanted to represent UCSB at the bargaining table, LaBonte’s answer was simple.</p>\n<p>“I got my bachelor’s degree here in geography in 1999. So I’ve been working in and out of this library since 1994. I love UCSB. I’m a lifelong Gaucho,” she said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The same feeling happened for me last year when we [started] Sunfest and students showed up!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFest, nicknamed “A Warm Up for the WarmUp,” is a festival hosted in Storke Plaza from 3  p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and was put together for the first time last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our biggest hope is that students are safe and they have choices,” Armistead added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also wrote that many of the alternative events were planned in “close consultation” with students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, who serves as the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) within Associated Students, said her office was particularly focused on education when preparing for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In coordination with the Alcohol and Drug Program, the office put together naloxone trainings for students to learn how to respond to opiod overdoses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her office also partnered with SBSO and UCPD to host a Pizza with the Police event at Woodstock’s Pizza from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, the EVPLA office will host a town hall at Pardall Center from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for community members to debrief Deltopia and discuss any concerns they might have had. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We basically just tried to fill up this week with as many events as possible in the spirit of education and prevention and providing resources,” Meijer said. This is the first time the EVPLA office has put together a prevention week, she said, and she hopes that the next EVPLA will continue to grow the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer has also been working with UCIV, a volunteer program to assist students when they’re out and about during Deltopia, to set up the hydration stations in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said he appreciates the work the student-led initiative has done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a big supporter of UCIV. I see the program as a valuable way that students have taken more responsibility over the IV community, and promoted a culture of greater safety during large events,” Brandt wrote in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt himself has volunteered with UCIV in the past, and has “enjoyed seeing the love and appreciation from students when we have handed out water, snacks, and condoms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking on Deltopia as a whole, Brandt echoed sentiments by Hoover, Armistead and Meijer that keeping I.V. safe is a community effort. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past few years, the trend towards fewer arrests and citations that we’ve seen are a testament to the work that students, law enforcement, and the community have done to try to change the culture in IV,” he wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer agreed, attributing the improvements in safety to the sheer number of organizations working together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of different people who are making an effort to have Deltopia be safe and have it be local, and have it be like a community event,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s safe and it’s local, then everyone who’s there is truly caring about the community because it’s our home. No one wants to make a mess in their own home.”</span></p>\n<p><i>Sofia Mejias-Pascoe contributed reporting.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

They recounted how excited some students were about the visibility of the trans flags at the fair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That excitement] was really affirming for us, as the RCSGD, who has been working really diligently and providing trans visibility on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center is also hosting several workshops throughout the week on interpersonal violence and sexual violence. Students will be able to attend discussions in a safe space to talk about their identities and personal experiences, along with issues facing their communities, Solis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD will be offering resources and paperwork for students who wish to legally change their name and/or gender on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The week will be ending with the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth annual Transgender Day of Visibility Celebration, sponsored by the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aryn Amezcua, a third-year UCSB student and Trans Task Force Advocacy Coordinator for the RCSGD, said the week has had a great impact on the community so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who come through, they thank us. They’re like, ‘We really like this, we needed this,’” Amezcua said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center also partnered with Richie’s Barber Shop in Isla Vista for a Beat and Barber event, where the shop provided free, gender-affirming haircuts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m familiar with the movement and I support it and I wanted to show my support. Everyone’s been really happy about it,” said Richie Ramirez, owner of Richie’s Barber Shop.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other businesses such as gc2b also worked with RCSGD to show support for the community. Gc2b, a trans-owned company dedicated to providing safe binding options for trans masculine people, donated eight chest binders to be given out as raffle prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The RCSGD managed to organize a large week of events due to the dedication of passionate people [students and staff] who wanted to create a vibrant and welcoming campus for the trans community,” Solis said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope this week creates momentum for other UCSB programs, departments, and student organizations to ask within their own spaces if trans students, faculty, and staff are represented and have a voice.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB as a whole has been working on fostering more support for transgender students, according to Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) recently introduced a new support group dedicated to trans and non-binary issues and experiences. The group, called TRANSformative, allows members to discuss issues related to transitioning, misgendering, bodies, relationships, medical care, transphobia and general life topics, according to the C.A.P.S. website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solis finds that UCSB has taken strides to create resources tailored to the trangender community but continually hears from students that more all-inclusive restrooms, medical access and curriculum are needed to support the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think more access to healthcare would be great, especially for trans students it can be very expensive. We don’t have the insurance and that’s already a huge setback,” Amezcua said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amezcua believes more pronoun awareness and training is needed for professors and teaching assistants in classroom settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully, we can expand [Trans Week] into a month next year with more planning and more collaborations. It’s just going to get bigger and better from here,” Solis said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
