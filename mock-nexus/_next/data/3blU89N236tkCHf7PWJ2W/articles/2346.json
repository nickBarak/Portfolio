Jimenez, a second-year undeclared major at UC Santa Barbara, settled on the idea for her interactive sculpture due to the recent impact of the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said in an email that the #MeToo Twitter hashtag recognizes how many people, mostly women, are sexually assaulted and “exposes the alarming numbers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said the project has a great deal of personal significance to her because she is a survivor of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she found it very difficult to acknowledge and speak of her experience, but that she regained a sense of hope and power after seeing the #MeToo movement trending on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing the project, Jimenez was initially worried that simply posting a large sign with the hashtag would be too obvious, but quickly noticed that many students were still unaware of the meaning behind the viral campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t want people to think that I was trying to turn a subject that’s so important and disgusting into just a pretty photo opp or something ‘aesthetic,’” she said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she believed it would be powerful to see how many flowers stacked up on her art piece, representing how many people have been affected by sexual assault directly or indirectly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students choose to complete their projects off campus in Isla Vista, but Jimenez said for her that was not an option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I insisted on my piece being on campus because that’s the main audience I wanted to view my piece: my own peers,” Jimenez wrote in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez chose to display her project at Storke Tower because she felt that is where it would attract the most visibility.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80218\" style=\"width: 1034px\"

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said art students are often deterred from displaying their final projects on campus due to the time constraints of the project and the difficulty of getting permission from the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez decided not to submit a request to display her piece on the Storke Tower lawn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I figured in the context of my own project, it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Jimenez could be creative with the idea and creation of the project, she said she is grateful for the input and help she received along the way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the project would not have been possible without the support of three people: her professor, her aunt who owns a Carpinteria flower shop and UCSB woodshop technician Michael Matheson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez said she has mostly received positive responses to her piece, yet some people are still unaware of the topic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that students have also responded positively on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All positive responses so far where people realize the importance of the topic and continue to make this a supportive platform for victims to feel heard, accepted, and loved,” she said in the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the days following the installment of her piece, students and faculty could be seen on Storke Tower lawn, placing flowers and silently observing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jimenez’s piece was left on Storke Tower lawn as students rushed home from UCSB due to the Thomas Fire. It remains there today, where Jimenez believes it will remain until maintenance staff returns to work.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-2.39.53-PM.png?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hannahjackson/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Hannah Jackson</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Hannah serves as the Editor-in-Chief and was previously Social Media Manager and Opinion Editor.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">“No es fácil andar en la calle [It’s not easy being on the streets],” says Hijinio Camacho.<em> Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Since the first week of classes, however, the university has prohibited Camacho and other off-campus vendors from selling on campus with student organizations.</p>\n<p>According to the Office of Student Life (OSL), the vendors’ sales violate the Environmental Health and Safety policies regarding food vendors unaffiliated with the university. OSL is only allowed to grant permits to campus organizations, not the companies and vendors who work with them.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, off-campus vendors have been allowed to sell products alongside student organizations with permits granted by OSL.</p>\n<p>According to Miles Ashlock, assistant dean and director of the Office of Student Life, the office wasn’t fully aware the vendors were violating university policies until a meeting on Sept. 25 with the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada.”</p>\n<p>— Hijinio Camacho</p></blockquote>\n<p>Camacho said he was notified about the policy reinforcements two days before school started. He then met with OSL on the first day of school to understand why he was no longer permitted to work with student organizations on campus.</p>\n<p>His first event of the school year was a fundraiser with the UCSB Promise Scholars.</p>\n<p>Camacho had planned events with Seoul’d Out, Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), <em>Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion, y Revolucion</em>, (M.U.J.E.R.) and the Latino Business Association. He started working with student organizations about two years ago and has held fundraisers with groups such as <em>Hermanas Unidas</em>, <em>Raices de Mi Tierra</em>, Alpha Phi Omega and Lambda Theta Alpha.</p>\n<p>Every school day of this year was booked for an event, Camacho said. Student organizations would typically keep 15 percent of the profit from the shared fundraisers.</p>\n<p>OSL, UCSB Concessions and the Office of Environmental Health and Safety are currently creating “more inclusive policies” that will lift the current restrictions surrounding off-campus vendors and allow vendors like Camacho to continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p>“We really want to figure out how to add [off-campus vendor permits] to the sorts of permits we are able to approve…both because it’s a good fundraising mechanism for them but also it has been a positive contribution to our campus,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Camacho met with OSL on Tuesday and told the <em>Nexus</em> he now needs two more permits from the university to work with student organizations. The two permits will allow him to sell on campus either once a week or once a month.</p>\n<p>Ashlock said the sudden policy revision further contributed to the frustration and confusion felt by both the students and the vendors because some vendors, like Camacho, already had events planned with student groups.</p>\n<p>“I have been been really clear with every conversation with my colleagues on how important it is that we figure this out, that we figure it out quickly, but also give good and clear advice,” Ashlock said. “That’s why it’s taking a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Camacho, who hails from Puebla, Mexico, has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. He spent time in I.V. during the early years of his time in the U.S. but found little success due to the demographic at the time.</p>\n<p>“When I arrived [in I.V.]… two years after arriving to this country, at that time there was mainly Asians and white people. It was 10 percent Latino,” Camacho said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79154\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"764019501\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79193\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79154\" data-attachment-id=\"79154\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/img_1111/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elote Hijinio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79154 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1111.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camacho has been selling elotes since he arrived in the United States 22 years ago. <em>Anthony Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Upon his return to Isla Vista two years ago, however, Camacho noticed more students of Latino descent at UCSB.</p>\n<p>UCSB was categorized as a Hispanic Serving Institute by the Association of Colleges and Universities in 2015 and has a 28 percent Chicano/Latino population, according to the 2016-2017 campus profile published by the Office of Budget and Planning.</p>\n<p>The rise in street food popularity over the years has opened the gates to members outside of the Latino community to indulge in Mexican snacks found on push-carts like Camacho’s.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been looking for you for two years!” exclaimed Jacqueline Liu, a third-year global studies and psychology double major, as she approached Camacho’s cart last week. Liu said she remembers living in a Mexican community as a child and taking money from her mother’s purse so she and her brother could buy snacks from their local elotero.</p>\n<p>With a large and increasing fan club comes busy schedules, as Camacho’s days often begin at 3 a.m. when he needs to pick up merchandise, ending at sundown when his day of selling is over.</p>\n<p>On other days, he arrives in I.V. at around 3 p.m. and begins his route on Picasso Road at Children’s Park, making his way down Embarcadero del Norte and down Pardall Road, with a stop in front of Freebirds along the way. From there he goes to Abrego Road and circles back onto Picasso Road.</p>\n<p>Camacho also created a Venmo account two years ago that allowed customers to buy from him without using cash. He has also made a Snapchat account with a Bitmoji character so customers can now locate him when he is in I.V. His username is “hijiniocamacho1.”</p>\n<p>Camacho has also sold food in Los Angeles, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Sacramento and Lompoc.</p>\n<p>In these cities, Camacho has been stopped by the police and forced to surrender his money and merchandise, as well as been robbed by local gangs. He said street vendors like himself encounter these obstacles on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Recent news coverage of street vendors has made their struggles visible to the public, but it only shows a small amount of what really goes on, Camacho said.</p>\n<p>The working conditions in the other cities pulled Camacho back to I.V. but he said even here he has faced issues with a local police officer.</p>\n<p>“<em>No es fácil andar en la calle</em> [It’s not easy being on the streets],” Camacho said.</p>\n<p>Despite the recent pause in selling on campus, Camacho said he hopes to stay in I.V. and continue to work with student organizations.</p>\n<p><em>“Pienso quedarme aquí porque aquí es donde yo he visto que los estudiantes te tratan como tal y como tú eres y no te distinguen porque no seas una persona educada, porque no seas una persona civilizada,” </em>Camacho said.<em> “Ellos te tratan tal y como eres porque ellos si se están preparando.”</em></p>\n<p>“Now that I’ve arrived for a second time, I’m thinking of staying here because here is where I have seen that the students treat you just like you are and don’t judge you because you’re not an educated person, because you’re not a civilized person,” Camacho said. “They treat you just as you are because they are preparing themselves [for their futures].”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 19, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/el-elotero-not-allowed-to-sell-on-campus/","id":2343,"author":{"id":81,"name":"Victoria Gurrola"},"related":[2342,2341,2340],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

mental illness during the Feb. 2 meeting. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate held a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee on Feb. 2 in response to the resolution passed on Jan. 24 in support of mentally disabled students in on-campus housing.</p>\n<p>The meeting was held by Senators Alison Sir and Anthony Pimentel and concluded with a plan to continue the discussion with university administrators and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)</p>\n<p>Sir read off an anonymous testimony from a student who removed from university housing due to a mental disability.</p>\n<p>“When I met with Housing and Judicial Affairs, they said I was banned because I violated the Personal Care Clause and my agreement, even though it was due to my mental illness,” Sir read from the testimony.</p>\n<p>The meeting began with a public forum to allow students of the UC Santa Barbara community to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of people who have had to go to Tropicana because of this clause and I’m here to say that as a personal representative of the RHA Coordinating Board, I’m just here to support you guys,” said Kevin Sabellico, San Rafael Hall Council Co-President.</p>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, Chair of the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), added that he needs to “make sure this is an appropriate goal for IVTU to be a part of.”</p>\n<p>In the approved plan of action, senators will split into three groups to collect information regarding the “Personal Care Clause” to present at a Town Hall meeting with the UCSB community in two weeks, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Three senators will meet with Housing and Residential Services, a second group will meet with C.A.P.S., and a third group will meet with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80789\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80789\"
