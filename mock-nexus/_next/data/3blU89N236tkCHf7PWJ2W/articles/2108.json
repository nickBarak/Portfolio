labor practice charge, filed by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 3229, alleges that the University of California attempted to stifle the union’s “ability to strike, to silence its voice, and to diminish its ranks,” according to the document submitted to the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PERB is the government agency responsible for regulating the bargaining statuses for public schools, universities, public employees and other government employees, according to the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.perb.ca.gov\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charge claims that UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act, which protects UC workers’ rights to unionize and allows collective bargaining to negotiate their own wages, benefits and working conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a systemic pattern of intimidation and creating an atmosphere of fear in the workplace,” AFSCME spokesperson John de los Angeles said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the most recent incidents happened during the UC campus-wide union strike on March 20, during which workers received citations from police, a consequence of protesting that workers had not previously experienced from UC, said de los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The workers] were hitting the picket line, making noise, but they always do and all of a sudden UCPD is now threatening them with police citations,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For them to change that expectation…  [creates] a sense of hesitance for some of our workers to come forward, voice concerns and even participate in these activities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filing lists examples of UC’s alleged failure to protect workers’ rights to protest, such as “workplace retaliation and police citation” and “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">condoning the violent physical assault of striking workers on the picket line.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The filing goes into specific details about incidents in which UC workers experienced violence, threats of arrest and discouragement from protesting. The filing also listed incidents where UC management offered rewards to workers not participating in strikes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the incidents included a UC Davis supervisor’s </span><a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2019/01/11/video-shows-alleged-uc-davis-employee-attack-afscme-3299-strikers-in-october/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attack</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on AFSCME strikers in Oct. 2018, UC Labor Relations misleading and intimidating communications to union employees and UC Police at UCSB and UC Los Angeles threatening workers with citations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These incidents and others surrounding the UC campus-wide protest on March 20 are a sign of the university’s attempt to subvert union efforts, de los Angeles said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these actions have a greater toll on union workers that just stifling protests, he added.</span></p>\n<p>“When the university is allowed to engage in these activities without consequences, the ultimate effect is actually a violation of workers’ rights and these are rights that are protected by state law,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re merely drawing attention to the fact that the university is openly and blatantly violating state law.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME’s recent strikes are part of a now three-year negotiation with UC for higher wages and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But UC has remained steadfast in its position on “AFSCME’s unreasonable demands for wage increases,</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, spokesperson and director of media relations for UC, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want raises that are nearly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">triple</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> those given to other UC employees,” Doan said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope AFSCME leaders will channel more time and effort into actual bargaining.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 27, the UC had not received a copy of the charges and could not comment on them or determine whether there was “any merit to these allegations,” Doan said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME leadership announced Friday that another strike will be taking place on April 10 in protest against UC’s conduct referred to in the suit.</span></p>\n<p>A copy of the filing in full can be read below: <object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-0325-Unfair-Practice-Charge-w-Exhs.-A-J-Redacted.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-0325-Unfair-Practice-Charge-w-Exhs.-A-J-Redacted.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Santa Barbara’s chapter of the union for teaching assistants, tutors, readers and more, put on the rally with the goal of pressuring the university into agreeing to a list of demands the workers compiled in light of UCPath’s failures, according to graduate student Cristina Awadalla, a member of UAW 2865.</p>\n<p>The demands include “issue back pay, resolve all outstanding pay issues, including overpayments and correcting W2s, and reparations for affected student-workers.”</p>\n<p>UC and UAW <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\">came to an agreement</a> on Feb. 25, offering additional payment for affected workers. Each student employee affected by UCPath will receive $150 after taxes, and employees with paycheck issues that spanned more than one month will receive additional compensation up to a maximum of $450.</p>\n<p>This agreement did not address backpay, overpayments or other issues.</p>\n<p>Throughout the protest, several speakers took the floor to discuss their frustrations with UCPath as well as with the path to achieving restitution.</p>\n<p>Some speakers mentioned personal anecdotes about how they had been affected with UCPath; one student worker, Department of Chicano Studies PhD student Mariano Nava Botello, had his car repossessed because he was not getting paid on time, according to a petition posted to the UAW Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Sheila Kulkarni, one of the speakers and a first-year chemistry graduate student at UCSB, expressed frustrations about how the university is dealing with UCPath issues.</p>\n<p>“I shouldn’t have to be in the Chancellor’s office to solve payroll issues or yell about my problems at Storke Tower,” Kulkarni said. “I never should have had to experience this nonsense in the first place.”</p>\n<p>After the speakers, the group of students and workers began their march, walking from Storke tower, through the Arbor walkway to finish at Cheadle Hall. Over the course of the march, the group maintained constant chants that advocated for workers’ rights on campus, such as, “One day longer, one day stronger.”</p>\n<p>As the protestors collected around Cheadle Hall, they again formed a group and reiterated the reasons behind the march through a microphone before walking into the administration building, where they searched for someone within the budget department to help the student workers with more serious financial problems caused by UCPath.</p>\n<p>After the issues with UCPath began in August 2018, UAW 2865 and the Graduate Student Association joined teams to address the university with their grievances.</p>\n<p>That partnership began pushing out surveys in October for students affected by UCPath in order to gather information on the extent of the payment problems.</p>\n<p>Providing proof of the issues of UCPath has been no small task, according to UAW sergeant-in-arms and graduate student, Lisa August-Schmidt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been asked as a union to prove that people haven’t been paid, so we have to file every single case individually and provide every single name,” August-Schmidt said.</p>\n<p>UCPath will be <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-01/ucpath-system-outage-to-occur-due-to-integration-of-new-uc-campuses/\">implemented</a> at two other UC campuses — UC Berkeley and UC Davis — during the month of March. During these implementations, the system will experience outages beginning March 1 at 5 p.m. through March 7 and then again from March 14 to March 20.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86620\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86620\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/","id":2107,"author":{"id":64,"name":"Aaron Berkness"},"related":[2106,2105,2104],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Union Employees Strike Amidst Contract Negotiations","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-03-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/17.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Throughout the day, waves of union employees marched through campus with chants.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minutes after Storke Tower delivered its 7 a.m. chime on Wednesday, hundreds of UC Santa Barbara employees pulled out their picket signs, raising retrofitted yard sticks as they began a one-day strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Representing the masses were two workers’ unions: American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 3229 (AFSCME) and University and Professional Technical Employees (UPTE).

AFSCME has gone on strike three times during this period, aiming to get better pay and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UPTE initiated the call for Wednesday’s strike; AFSCME, as well as several United Automobile Workers 5810 (UAW) members, later joined in solidarity and support of their shared interests regarding the result of UPTE’s ongoing contract negotiations with the University of California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to have the university recognize how important it is to us, where we’ll take a day without pay to try and get these fair wages and maintain our healthcare plan,” said Michael Holford, a member of UPTE who also works in UCSB’s Communication Services department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the strike, union workers made beelines around campus – from Henley Gate to Cheadle Hall – in a demand for better treatment by the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babe Gonzalez, a representative for AFSCME 3229 and a Student Health employee, said the UC’s current offer to employees does not accommodate workers’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC is wanting to give us a lump sum of money in exchange for job security, in exchange for outsourcing jobs,” Gonzalez said, noting the UC’s lack of attention to what she believes union workers really need: “We need our job to continue. We don’t need a lump sum of money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another concern voiced through the microphones involved livable wages. Jarrod Coldron, an AFSCME representative, former UCSB student and present-day groundskeeper at the university, said he is fearful that the cost of living in Isla Vista might force him out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really like my job here, but it’s really expensive to live in Isla Vista, and if I don’t have a good contract, I won’t be able to afford to live here as long as I want to,” Coldron said. “I’m just trying to keep this affordable for me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the only groundskeeper currently residing in I.V., Coldron explained that his coworkers often commute from other areas in the county to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I’m the only groundskeeper on campus that lives in l.V. Everybody else is in Lompoc or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carpentaria. A lot of people live far away and bus in,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to UCOP representative Claire Doan, the UC finds that UPTE is asking too much from the institution and has been unreasonable with their demands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are disappointed with UPTE leadership, demanding unreasonable double-digit raises (16 to 22 percent over the proposed terms of the agreement) that are far beyond those given to other UC employees. Since negotiations began in 2017, our offers have been fair and substantial, guaranteeing competitive wage increases and excellent benefits,” Doan said in an email with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meanwhile, UPTE leaders have neither presented a realistic counteroffer, nor have they let their members vote on UC’s proposals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said she believes the UC’s resistance to forming a better contract is derived from a poor understanding of the situation. At a university, Gonzalez said that a vital function of the workplace is “to make sure that they are respectful of their members,” which includes students at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC doesn’t seem to realize how important we are. We are the first contact when a student comes to the Health Center, when they’re having someone clean their dorms … They don’t go to the offices to see people. They don’t know who they are, they know who we are, and they know that we care,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary Colmenar, a librarian at UCSB, offered a similar sentiment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important for us to tell the administration that we’re the people who actually work and run the university,” Colmenar said, who also noted a dry spell in contracts for the library’s worker union, University of California American Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT), which has dragged on for over six months.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86998\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-86998\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86998\" data-attachment-id=\"86998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Labor Strike_Devin Ralston_ONLINE (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86998\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the day, waves of union employees marched through campus with chants, aiming to not only build energy, but also to voice their complaints.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At noon, multiple speakers spoke at a rally for the workers, all of whom funneled the sentiments of those chants into the messages of their speeches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Oscar Soto, a graduate student at UCSB, took the stage, he turned the microphone to the crowd and began to ask them questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the question: “How many of you are undergrads?” many students raised their hands. A substantial, but fewer, number of palms raised in the air when Soto asked how many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">workers were graduate students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But zero hands broke the plane when he asked if anyone was a professor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What does this tell you about the university?” Soto asked in response to his own questions. “What does it tell you about the importance of what they [UC] put in front of the table?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez finds that the lack of support from upper-level employees at the UC, such as professors and administrators, has led to a revolving door of frustration for many campus employees.

It just seems like all of the UC Regents have all their retirement cut out, they have their pensions, they have their raises, and they do a lot of work, but they have to realize that we’re valuable,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re family, we’re family with students, and they don’t have that connection like we do, and if they did, they’d really appreciate helping down the line.”</span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the strike can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 23, 2:31 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
