The apartments consist of several three-story buildings and 109 total apartment spaces with three varying floor plans. Parts of the complex are still under construction, including faculty housing and the administration and recreation buildings scheduled for completion in the next two to three weeks.</p>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies and sociology double major Kevin Tang said he was assigned to live in Sierra Madre; he enjoys living there and prefers it over his apartment at Santa Ynez last year.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t choose to live here; I got randomly assigned, but I like it a lot. It’s nice to have a new apartment and not have to share a shower with more than one person,” Tang said in an email. “I lived in Santa Ynez before and it definitely a lot nicer [here], especially the new appliances, also there’s a lot less ants.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Allie Lobos said she chose to live at Sierra Madre and though the new apartments are clean, she dislikes the 1.8 mile commute to campus.</p>\n<p>“Living here is great. It’s new, it’s clean, but I wish I did live in Isla Vista,” Lobos said. “My biggest complaint is the distance; I have three 8 a.m.s a week.”</p>\n<p>Tang said despite the distance, he would be willing to choose to live in Sierra Madre Village Apartments again.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of far and taking the bus can be annoying when I miss it and become late for class, but I like it a lot and would choose to live here again,” Tang said again, in an email.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major and transfer student Vanessa Guevara said she likes living farther from campus and closer to the supermarkets, and she is looking forward to the completion of the convenience store and recreational building.</p>\n<p>“I like how far it is; it feels more secluded from the main campus and it’s close to groceries,” Guevara said in an email. “I hope the store and gym opens soon though. I bike so it’s not really a problem and the living space is nice especially since it was just built.”</p>\n<p>Project Executive Joe Linden said the administration and recreation building will be completed in two to three weeks’ time, and until then students will be surrounded in a loud environment. Linden also said the faculty building which burned down July 4, 2014 is nearing completion.</p>\n<p>“Everything is on schedule but some community buildings still have about two weeks left,” Linden said. “Building seven which is located by Whittier and Storke Road has two to three weeks left as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/","id":2705,"author":{"id":144,"name":"Jonathan Mendez"},"related":[2704,2703,2702],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":144,"name":"Jonathan Mendez","biography":"Not available","articles":[2615,2630,2639,2649,2655,2662,2685,2705],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B) met for their first meeting of Fall Quarter on Monday in the UCen State Street Room.</p>\n<p>The Committee heard from six student organizations including Students for Life of America, Laughology, Mab Productions, UCSB Model United Nations (MUN), Sketch ‘N’ Sniff and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC). A.S. F&amp;B fully funded Students for Life of America and partially funded the other five student groups.</p>\n<p>IFC Vice President of Communications Austin Hechler requested $15,000 to bring RL Grime to the Thunderdome on Nov. 10 for a benefit concert to raise funds to improve Greek Park.</p>\n<p>“If you have seen the park recently it is really run down with basketball courts that have cracks all over it, volleyball courts with weeds going everywhere,” Hechler said. “All fraternities and sororities will be represented in this park and this park is not just exclusively for Greeks; anyone who wants to host an event there can host an event there. We just want to make sure that it looks aesthetically good.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted IFC $10,000 for stage and lighting expenses and tabled the remaining $5,000, asking Hechler to return the following week to answer further questions.</p>\n<p>A representative of Students for Life of America said the group will use the $500 allocated for venue and security fees for a debate on abortion they plan to host on Oct. 21 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We are hopefully going to have a philosophical debate about abortion,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Board member Nawar Nemeh said he is concerned only one side of the debate is advertising for the event.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it will be a problem, but we should keep in mind that the advertising is being done by one side of the issue and it is a philosophical debate on a controversial issue,” Nemeh said. “I don’t know if we can fund, like, an independent entity and can advertise for them.”</p>\n<p>But A.S. F&amp;B Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez said, the Committee should not consider the content of the group’s event when deciding whether or not to fund it.</p>\n<p>“Any decision you make on funding for any event has to be content-neutral so we don’t make decisions on what the content is of any speaker that comes here,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Laughology President Matthew Ducket requested funding for this year’s performances including regular Saturday night shows, a possible live broadcast from Jake and Amir from College Humor and a show with comedian Moshe Kasher who appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon”<em>, </em>“Conan” and “@midnight.”</p>\n<p>“We put on a free show every Saturday at 8 at Embarcadero Hall,” Ducket said. “We do that every Saturday with the exception of during Thanksgiving, dead week and finals week.”</p>\n<p>According to Ducket, A.S. has funded Laughology in previous years.</p>\n<p>“A.S. has kind of been the backbone for us, at least for the past four years that I have been part of this club,” Ducket said. “We typically get the majority of our funding from you guys and it really helps us to put on not just our shows in general but put on great shows.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted Laughology $1,120 of the requested $1,570.</p>\n<p>A Mab Productions representative requested $2,500 for its 25th Annual Monologue Festival, which will take place the first or second weekend of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The Monologue Festival comprises a series of monologues that are written by UCSB students, performed by UCSB students and are acted by UCSB students from majors all across campus,” the representative said. “I personally directed a monologue that was written by a thermodynamics student and acted by one of the Bachelor of Fine Arts students from the Department of Theater and Dance, being an English major myself.”</p>\n<p>The representative said Mab wants to expand its reach beyond campus and the requested money would fund advertising throughout Santa Barbara in publications such as the <em>Independent</em>.</p>\n<p>“We are asking for slightly more funding for advertising to explore some things like putting an ad in the newspaper or possibly on the radio,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer Kevin Koo said he did not want the Committee to fund high advertising costs that do not target UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“I do a lot of work in advertising and I just think this number is not very feasible,” Koo said. “I would like to see that cost lower.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted Mab $1,500 of the requested $2,500 and advised the group to advertise in the <em>Daily Nexus</em> and <em>The Bottom Line. </em></p>\n<p>“I understand how you want to build a big audience group, but I kind of want to put students first in this opinion,” Koo said.</p>\n<p>UCSB MUN Under-Secretary-General of External Affairs Akshaya Natarajan requested $4,465 to take 12 delegates to the TrojanMUN Conference Oct. 29 through Nov. 1 at the University of Southern California.</p>\n<p>“We are an academic travel team and competitive team that goes to conferences and hosts our own conferences here on campus that simulates the United Nations,” Natarajan said. “We do a lot of this primarily around debate, research, public speaking, things like that.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted UCSB MUN $2,836 of the requested $4,469.</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B also allocated the improvisation group Sketch ‘N’ Sniff $1,300 of the requested $1,900 for ads and facility fees.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

annual Pardall Carnival Oct. 3 from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Pardall Road.</p>\n<p>The carnival will feature a Ferris wheel, games, prizes, free food and more than 60 different campus organizations and

Food Bank and COSWB will provide services at the event.</p>\n<p>“A.S Food Bank’s table that will be hosting a food distribution, as well as UCSB’s COSWB will be there providing free yoga to carnival-goers,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>Hanna said IVCRC will reward game participants at the carnival with “Pardollas,” which they redeem at I.V. restaurants on the day of the event.</p>\n<p>“If people participate in any of the free games we have going on, they will receive Pardollas in which they can use in restaurants that are participating to score deals on free food,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>According to IVCRC publicity manager and third-year global studies major Lauren Lim, the carnival will feature free activities music from KCSB-FM.</p>\n<p>“We really want to emphasize that there will be tons of free giveaways and games to participate in,” Lim said. “I’m really excited about KCSB attending and providing cool DJ sets for people to listen to while they’re there as well.”</p>\n<p>Lim said IVCRC expects a large turnout at the carnival.</p>\n<p>“We have over 1,000 people that have RSVPed on the Facebook event, but we are anticipating way more than that to attend on the day of,” Lim said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/carnival-to-feature-games-food/","id":2704,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2703,2702,2701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s New Diversity Status Merits $2.6 Million Grant","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara was awarded a $2.6 million grant on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Education for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS) after meeting the qualifications of a Hispanic-S...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara was awarded a $2.6 million grant on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Education for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS) after meeting the qualifications of a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was named a U.S. Department of Education’s Developing HSI in January by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities because at least 25 percent of its total enrollment is comprised of Hispanic students. The grant for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS), a Title V program, will be distributed over five years and will focus on improving student success and graduation rates by expanding educational opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director of Research Development for the Social Sciences, Humanities and Fine Arts in the UCSB Office of Research Barbara Endemaño Walker said the grant will provide access to summer “enrichment” resources such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and the ONDAS Success Center which provide support from community scholars, peer tutoring and a designated study space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ITS we plan to use is ALEKS, which was originally developed at UC Irvine,” Walker said in an email. “It is used at several UC’s, and the UCSB Chemistry Department already uses it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Walker, 10 majors and 41 courses were found to put students at risk of probation and impeded graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Undergraduate students are placed on probation when their cumulative GPA drops below 2.0,” Walker said in an email. “We determined which first year courses (for both freshmen and transfer students) … have a combination of both high enrollment and the lowest final average GPA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the grant will focus on first-year experiences and faculty professional development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It aims] to address the challenges of underrepresented and low-income students in certain majors and to help with the first-year retention rates,” Dela Cruz said. “That, to me, is very important because I come from a low-income community that is certainly underrepresented — I come from Compton.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker said the ONDAS Success Center will remain active after the five-year grant program ends through financial funding sources such as grants, gifts and campus resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grant will begin this fall,” Walker said in an email. “We will be piloting and ramping up the programs over the next year, and plan to have ONDAS fully operating by fall 2017.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said the grant will improve student life and student representation in “more competitive” majors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I ultimately hope this grant is going to help students of all backgrounds excel in majors where they traditionally have not,” Mirza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dela Cruz said she notices her friends struggling in STEM majors such as chemical engineering and biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of them actually changed their majors,” Dela Cruz said “One of my best friends was on academic probation because she was not excelling in those classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dela Cruz, the grant will address issues impacting minority and marginalized groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By looking specifically at these issues, you are allowing a diverse group of individuals to feel comfortable on this campus,” Dela Cruz said. “You are trying to find alternative ways, creative ways, to make this group of students feel comfortable and make them successful individuals.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mirza said he hopes students as well as administrators will play active roles in deciding how the grant money should best be allocated to aid minority students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully, there is a maximum amount of student consultation and outreach in regards to where this money is going to be sent, in particular, with the communities with whom these grants have been issued,” Mirza said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/","id":2702,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2701,2700,2699],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
