On a learning curve after going 8-9-2 last season, this group of 19 underclassmen has exceeded last year’s standards and proved to Head Coach Paul Stumpf that they are ready to play.</p>\n<p>Reaching the midway point of the preseason with an overall record of 4-2-1, UCSB has bounced back from tough losses early on to Saint Mary’s and USF to go on a five-game unbeaten streak. Now in the final two weeks of non-conference play, the Gauchos are getting hot just in time for conference play in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“We have a couple new layers we can add to our play after facing these diverse teams,” Stumpf said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB took care of business on the road last weekend as it traveled to Pennsylvania.  Facing off against Atlantic-10 opponents Duquesne and Saint Francis, this was a great chance for the Gauchos to solidify their chemistry and work out all their kinks before the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos did so in dramatic fashion against a red hot 3-1-1 Dukes team. Trailing 1-0 in the final six minutes of play, UCSB knew it had one more attack before the end of regulation. Sophomore midfielder Chase Schornstein took advantage of this opportunity as she collected a pass over a Dukes defender from junior Dakota Griggs and launched a kick to the back of the goal post for the 1-1 equalizer.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t long until freshman midfielder/forward Mallory Hromatko made her mark on the game as well, blasting a shot from the left side of the box into the right corner and sealing a 2-1 victory for the Gauchos in overtime.</p>\n<p>Hromatko wasn’t the only notable freshman that had a productive weekend. Sydney Magnin took advantage of her starting lineup job against 0-6-1 Saint Francis. The midfielder knocked in two goals for the Gauchos, one in the 4th and another in the 33rd minute of play, propelling her team to a 3-2 victory.</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos head back to Meredith Field with hopes of extending their winning streak to five games.</p>\n<p>Their success thus far can be accredited to their impressive core of freshmen. Hromatko has carried the load for the Gauchos starting all nine games at forward and leading the team in scoring with nine points and three goals. The Danville, CA native earned herself a Big West Player of the Week nomination last week and looks to be the offensive anchor heading into the conference season.</p>\n<p>Jessica Parque, Dakota Griggs and Magnin hope to complement Hromatko’s dominant play on the offensivee side of the field as the regular season progresses. The three freshmen have combined for a total of four goals and four assists, all within their last three games.</p>\n<p>“These players are not freshman anymore,” said Stumpf. “They’re nine games in against some of the best competition and the experience they’ve drawn [from these matches] will prepare them for a very tough conference schedule ahead.”</p>\n<p>Schornstein and junior center midfielder Sara Feder will offer some valuable leadership to these young freshmen. Schornstein and Feder were valuable pieces to the team last season, scoring seven goals on the year. Both players were recognized for their play as Schornstein was named to the Big West All-Freshman team and Feder as an All-Big West Honorable Mention.</p>\n<p>The Big West will be a new level of intensity for the Gauchos but Stumpf is optimistic for the beginning of conference play as his players have been familiar with this type of competitive play prior to playing for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I believe our team will be prepared as most of our players have come from really talented clubs teams who are used to competing at the highest level,” Stumpf said. “If we keep all of our opponents at one to two goals, we’re going to do some damage in this conference because we will score goals moving forward.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play a pair of home games this weekend against Montana at 5:00 p.m. on Friday and Dayton at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This article appeared on page 12 of September 17, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64664\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64664\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/wsoc/","id":1499,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1498,1497,1496],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Look to Extend Winning Streak Away at UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to continue its winning stretch in its midweek match at UC Davis.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Considering that the UCSB men’s soccer team’s closest performance so far this season came last Saturday in a double overtime thriller against UC Irvine, it means the Gauchos have been continuing their fine form even on the road.</p>\n<p>This Wednesday, away at Irvine, will be Santa Barbara’s third and final matchup of their midseason road series. While currently 1-0-1 during away games, UCSB are also undefeated on the season at a 3-0-1 record. They’ll try to keep their winning ways afloat however, as they face off against a 2-1-1 UC Davis side who currently hold the third place position on the Big West league standings.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, even with the Gauchos’ impressive start, a win for UC Davis will be enough to hoist them up to the first place spot. So UCSB will be in fully competitive spirits in order to assert their conference domination even more. Expect another low scoring affair due to the Aggies lack of offense and the Gauchos on the road productivity, but quite a heated game as each side of the pitch would like to find the back of the net early on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Looking back on last Saturday’s game, a lot can be taken away from the defensive end. Specifically so, straight from the goalkeeper himself: UCSB freshman Alan Carillo. Carillo, who currently averages only a single goal allowed per game, has recently been awarded his 2<sup>nd</sup> honor as the Big West Defensive Player of the Week. With a clean sheet already on record, and coming off an outstanding 8 save game versus Irvine, he is truly on fire and it’s helping pave the way for UCSB’s continued success.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos attacking third of the pitch, a clear cut MVP for the early part of the season can be found in freshman forward Rodney Michael. With already the most goals for the team (5) and the most assists as well (4), Michael has seemingly found himself to be a part of the match highlights week in and week out.</p>\n<p>A recurring trend can be spotted here considering underclassmen play has been very vital for UCSB thus far. Altogether combined, Gaucho underclassmen have notched a grand total of 14 goals and 11 assists on the year. So it’s clear to see that the men’s soccer program’s future is bright and head coach Tim Vom Steeg has done his due diligence during the offseason scouting.</p>\n<p>When analyzing UC Davis’ current team performance, praise can be given to them on the final third of the pitch. However, not much offensive productivity has been observed so far. With only 5 goals over their first 4 conference games, it can be argued that the Aggies have yet to click; it’s unlikely they’ll finally get things going come Wednesday night when they face off against an ever stout UCSB backline. UC Davis are led by junior forward Matt Baringer and senior midfielder Miguel Acevedo, whom both have 3 goals on the year and 2 assists apiece.</p>\n<p>The Aggies last game definitely didn’t go their way as they fell 2-0 to UC Riverside. In perspective, UC Riverside is dead last in Big West conference standings and the Gauchos bested them a couple weeks ago at home by a score of 3-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters this week’s matchup as the slight favorite, but this game can still go either way. The Gauchos also lead in their all time record against the Aggies by a score of 22-8-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will visit UC Davis this Wednesday, October 11 at 4 p.m. They will also host Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry this Saturday, Oct. 14 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

However, neither side could break through as by the end of the half neither side had managed to put any offensive pressure on the other. At halftime, both teams had one shot, zero saves, and only one corner kick from UCSB.</p>\n<p>The teams were able to find their rhythm in the second half of the match with each side getting five shots off. UCSB was able to get four corner kicks as part of their efforts in making junior CSUN goalkeeper Henrik Regitnig work in the second half, forcing him to make four saves. Despite the chances on offense to score, UCSB could not put the ball in the net and the match ended at a regulation time in a draw bringing on overtime.</p>\n<p>CSUN was able to put together chances of their own in the first overtime period with three shots, which were unable to get past Gaucho keeper Alan Carrillo. Carrillo and the UCSB defense held strong in the first overtime period and were able to keep the team in the game long enough to find a chance for the team to score.</p>\n<p>That opportunity came in the second half of overtime in the 106th minute, where Gaucho freshman Rodney Michael got through two Matador defenders and played the ball to sophomore Noah Billingsley, who was able to put the ball past the CSUN keeper Regitnig from the right side of the box.</p>\n<p>The shot was good for the golden goal earning the Gauchos the win, 1-0 in 2OT, increasing their win streak to five. The UCSB defense also continued their shutout streak at the end of this game, bringing their total shutouts for the season to five. The Gauchos ended Thursday night with an overall record of 5-4-2, and 3-0 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then went south to play the University of California, Irvine Anteaters, at Anteater Stadium, Saturday night. Headed into the match, UCI had an overall record of 6-4-2 and 1-1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The second North-South division matchup of the trip began with an explosion of offense from both sides. Neither side was able to put a point on the board until the 28th minute where senior Anteater Giovanni Godoy drew a foul in the penalty box bringing senior teammate Mario Ortiz to the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>Ortiz was able to put the ball past UCSB keeper Alan Carrillo, giving the senior his third goal of the season. The offense from both sides continued as 18 shots were taken between the two teams by the end of the first half, but surprisingly it was only Ortiz’s shot which was on the board, giving UCI the lead at 1-0.</p>\n<p>UCI found themselves in their own end as UCSB was able to take possession and create some chances for good shots on goal. The Anteater defense was forced to try to stop the Gauchos as they took their own turn on the offensive end in a second half that would see nine shots taken by the away team.</p>\n<p>UCI was able to take six shots of their own in the second half and did have an opportunity to increase their lead, but Gaucho keeper Carrillo kept them out of the net earning four saves.</p>\n<p>It was in the 83rd minute where UCSB would finally get the finishing chance they needed to execute on when junior forward Jonah Adomakoh played the ball along the right wing to freshman standout Rodney Michael who sent the shot into the net for his fifth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>The match would slowly wind down, ending in regulation at 1-1, and the Gauchos would find themselves in another OT period.</p>\n<p>The first OT period found the Anteaters with yet another helping of steady offensive play. Their closest chance came in the 95th minute on a header that went off the far post and was unable to be put away by any Anteater.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense was able to hold steady throughout both overtime periods, not allowing a successful offensive outburst in the first and keeping the Anteater offense quiet in the second.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense found nothing in the OT periods and could not put ahead a second golden goal after staving off a valiant UCI offense. The match would be played to a draw at 1-1 at the end of 2OT.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played well this week in their first instances of conference road play. Earning the exciting win against CSUN and getting a draw against UC Irvine are good signs for a heavily-favored squad which is looking to get ahead early.</p>\n<p>The next match for the Gauchos will

It’s a grind and in each game you just have to keep getting better.”</p>\n<p>The win on Friday improves the Gauchos’ record to 3-2-1 overall, while Charleston falls to an identical mark of 3-2-1.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long to get the action started, as UCSB forward Ahinga Selemani was aggressive early. After the sophomore transfer earned a corner just under six minutes in, junior midfielder Josue Espana set up Sam Strong for his first career NCAA goal. Espana’s corner sailed over a wave of players at the near post before falling perfectly to the freshman defender inside the six-yard box for an easy header, putting UCSB up 1-0.</p>\n<p>It took only 85 seconds for the Cougars to answer back. Junior midfielder Eric Clark’s free kick found sophomore defender Cesar Murillo to tie it at 1-1, marking the first time the Gauchos have conceded a first half goal this season.</p>\n<p>“We have to eliminate making that one big mistake,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re playing with a young back line and I still feel like our communication, our spacing, we’re still prone to make a mistake going up for the same ball, so we just have to keep working on that.”</p>\n<p>After junior left back Ismaila Jome left the game with an ankle injury about 15 minutes in, freshman midfielder Geoffrey Acheampong filled in and was a menace on the offensive side. The former Cate School star led the way with two assists, his first coming with just over 26 minutes left in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We got some good performances from some different players. In particular, I thought [Geoffrey] played his best college game,” Vom Steeg said. “We were planning to bring Geoffrey into [Jome’s] position anyway, but there was no need to actually bring Ish back into that game the way that Geoffrey was playing.”</p>\n<p>With his third corner attempt in under a minute, Acheampong played a ball into a packed six-yard box where junior forward Nick DePuy was able to establish position over his defender and place a header just inside the far post, giving his team a 2-1 lead heading into the half. Santa Barbara has now scored first in each of its six games and taken a lead into halftime in all but one.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s goal was his fourth of the season, tied for first in the Big West, and the eighth game-winner of his career. In the 12 games that DePuy has scored, the Gauchos have gone an undefeated 9-0-3.</p>\n<p>With just under 22 minutes to go in the game, Acheampong played in a low cross that found junior midfielder Andy Perez at the far post where he was able to power a deflected shot in off a defender to seal the 3-1 win.</p>\n<p>“I just saw two guys trying to crash the box and my job was just to get it into the six,” Acheampong said. “It’s kind of a gray area there where the keeper doesn’t really know to stay or come out, so I just put it in between for Nick or Andy to crash it and it just landed at Andy’s foot.”</p>\n<p>UCSB found itself threatening early and often, outshooting Charleston 21-4 on the night. Goalkeeper Kevin Shields was the easy choice for man of the match for the visiting side, as the junior made nine saves to keep the score line respectable.</p>\n<p>“I did feel like our offense really started to come alive today,” Vom Steeg said. “We really wore that team down, so our energy and our running was good.”</p>\n<p>Despite the win, it wasn’t all smiles for the Gauchos. Already missing junior midfielder Drew Murphy to an ankle injury, UCSB now might also be without its starting left back Jome as well against UCLA after he suffered an apparent sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>The game was also delayed for an extended period of time in the first half when Charleston’s Eric Clark needed to be carted off after taking a hard fall while challenging for a header.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now shift their attention to tonight, where they will face a hostile Bruin crowd in a Pac-12 televised game. UCSB most recently fell to UCLA at Harder Stadium 1-0 last season and has not defeated its UC counterpart since 2011, going 0-3-1 since that last win.</p>\n<p>The Bruins enter with a 2-3 record this season, most recently ousting Big West opponent Cal Poly 4-1 on Friday. UCLA’s youth has powered it so far this season with seven of its eight goals coming from its underclassmen. Freshman midfielder Jackson Yueill and sophomore forward Seyi Adekoyi lead the way with two goals each.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is set to kickoff at 7:00 p.m. at Drake Stadium and will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64756\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64756\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-21/ucsb-handles-college-of-charleston-at-home-travels-to-ucla-tonight/","id":1498,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1497,1496,1495],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
