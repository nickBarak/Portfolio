Joining Boateng at Harder Stadium in the fall will be New Jersey native Nick Savino (Moorestown High School), as well as three college transfers: Creighton’s senior forward Dion Acoff, Belhaven University’s junior forward Achille Campion and Oregon State’s redshirt freshman defender Brandon Brockway.</p>\n<p>At Cate School in Carpinteria, Calif., Boateng was able to lead the Rams to a 30-1-1 record over the past two seasons, including an undefeated 22-0-0 record last season. Boateng scored 26 goals and notched 18 assists in the Rams’ journey to the California State Championship this past season, and was ranked No. 9 overall on College Soccer News’ 2012 high school recruiting list.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Ema is very familiar to most soccer fans in town,” Vom Steeg said to TopDrawerSoccer.com. “He is a dynamic player who has an exceptional left foot. We see him playing more on the left hand side, though we also look at him in the middle; he can beat players off the dribble, he can score goals.”</p>\n<p>Boateng will be able to immediately have an impact on a Gaucho squad that needs more legs in the midfield position after losing multiple senior leaders last season.</p>\n<p>“Ema will go a long way toward replacing a couple spots that we lose, one being (James) Kiffe on the left side and he could also potentially help to replace what (Luis) Silva did for us,” Vom Steeg told TopDrawerSoccer.com.</p>\n<p>Savino will be joining UCSB as a freshman ready to learn from next year’s senior goalkeeper and likely starter, André Grandt. Savino’s performance on the soccer pitch during his senior year earned him All-State New Jersey, All-South Jersey All-Star and All-Burlington County awards.</p>\n<p>“With André (Grandt) being a senior and Austin (Mansker) coming off of his injury, we absolutely need another goalkeeper in our program that we feel can push the other goalies,” Vom Steeg said. “Even though Nick is young, because he is very aggressive and athletic, we feel that he is someone that will fight to get himself on the field and somebody that we can work with going forward.”</p>\n<p>In addition to two highly regarded freshman additions, the UCSB coaching staff is able to bring on senior Acoff, who scored three goals last year for the Bluejays and was No. 4 on the team in shots on goal with a .341 percentage. Acoff is a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference standout and helped Creighton to a No. 2 finish in last year’s College Cup.</p>\n<p>“He’s a dynamic, explosive player with great pace and the ability to beat you,” Vom Steeg told TopDrawerSoccer.com. “Against us (during the 2011 NCAA Third Round), I thought he was the best player on the field and I also thought he was very good at the Final Four.”</p>\n<p>Campion comes to UCSB from Stella, France, and brings a new element of size to the Gaucho frontline. The 6’2”, 200-pound Campion tallied 17 goals and led his team with 61 shots and 33 shots on goal this past season.</p>\n<p>Joining Campion on the far half of the pitch will be Brockway, who redshirted his freshman year at Oregon State and joins the Gauchos with four years of athletic eligibility remaining. At Todd Beamer High School in Tacoma, WA, Brockway was an All-League and All-Area honoree as a senior.</p>\n<p>“With the departure of Tim Pontius to the Seattle Sounders, we are excited to have Brandon’s size, athleticism and passing ability to compliment our back line,” Vom Steeg told TopDrawerSoccer.com.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos look forward to an exciting pre-season schedule in which they will host Westmont, Valparasio, UCLA and Harvard at home before beginning Big West Conference play. All home games will be played at Harder Stadium on the UCSB campus, with the Westmont match set as a season opener on Aug. 18 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/filling-voids/","id":1654,"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella"},"related":[1653,1652,1651],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":78,"name":"Brent Pella","biography":"Not available","articles":[716,743,762,820,848,852,1078,1644,1646,1647,1648,1649,1651,1654,1662,1665,1667,1671,1672,1673,1677,1678,1679,1683,1684,1686,1688,1690,1693,1694,1695,1696,1700,1719,1757,1761,1764,1767,1768,2160,2844,4375,4473,4491,4502,4510,4511,4512,4513,4514,4515,4516,4517,4519,4520,4527,4528,4530,4532,4536,4537,4538,4542,4543,4547,4557,4559,4561,4562,4564,4565,4566,5533],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Defeated by Creighton in Third Round of NCAA’s","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men's soccer team was defeated 2-1 in third round action of the NCAA tournament against Creighton in Omaha, Nebraska on Sunday.

Creighton attempted 17 shots overall, including twelve attempts in the first half that yielded two goals.</p>\n<p>Both of Creighton’s goals were scored on dead-ball plays, the first a penalty against junior forward Sam Garza within the box just seven minutes into the first half. Garza’s foul call was met with frustration from the UCSB sideline and allowed Creighton’s Bruno Castro to put the Blue Jays up 1-0 on the PK.</p>\n<p>“It was about the worst way to start a game,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We were very confused as to what the call even was. He had told Sam Garza not to hold [Creighton’s Ethan Finlay] and Sam said he was not holding him, but obviously referee saw differently.”</p>\n<p>A second goal came just ten minutes later when Andrew Ribeiro was able to connect on a corner kick play. Ribeiro’s low strike on the ground after a deflection was made amidst a swarm of blue and white jerseys, and crept past junior goalkeeper Andre Grandt to push the Blue Jay lead to 2-0, a margin that UCSB was unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>“It was really tough coming back from two goals down early on,” Sarle said. “We had a chance in the last ten minutes but it’s always tough going down two like that. Especially against Creighton who has only given up a handful of goals all year.”</p>\n<p>The game was physical throughout the 90-minute stretch. Questionable calls toward the end of regulation were met with furious reactions from the UCSB sideline, including the ejection of assistant coach Greg Curry with just over five minutes remaining in the game. The ejection came after Curry’s reaction toward a yellow-card call against senior midfielder Luis Silva that sent a Creighton player to the ground in front of the UCSB bench. Two yellow cards were issued to Creighton, while three were given to UCSB. The Gauchos also received two red cards, both with under five minutes remaining in the match.</p>\n<p>Grandt had arguably his best performance of the year with a season-high eight saves throughout the match. Opoku led all shooters with three shots.

The team lost incredible goal scorers in Sam Garza and Luis Silva, but the Gaucho’s recruiting class was voted tenth in the nation by College Soccer News.</p>\n<p>“People won’t even notice that Silva and Garza are gone,” David said. “The new recruits are unbelievable. They blend with the team really well.”</p>\n<p>One player expected to help fill the gaps and score goals is freshman midfielder Ema Boateng, the Gatorade National High School Player of the Year for men’s soccer.</p>\n<p>“He is fast … you can’t stop him,” David said. “People don’t know what’s coming, but he’s going to cause trouble. He’s going to score goals.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Dion Acoff also joins the team after transferring from Creighton where he was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection. Acoff was named to the 2012 Preseason All- Conference Team along with David and senior defender Peter McGlynn.</p>\n<p>Also joining the midfield for the Gauchos is junior Goffin Boyoko. Boyoko transferred from Auburn University Montgomery, where he earned 2011 NAIA First Team All-American and All-Southern States Athletic Conference First Team honors.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got really experienced players coming into the program, so they have a feel for college soccer,” Baiden said. “We have a deep team. There is somebody ready to step in at every position.” Returning for UCSB to aid the attack is junior forward Dom Sarle, and senior midfielders Josue Madueno and David. Both Sarle and Madueno were 2011 All- Big West players. David looks to return after missing significant time due to injury.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a group show because everyone can score goals, even our defenders,” David said. “Last year we looked to Silva; this year everyone can score.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, UCSB returns the majority of its starting lineup, including junior defender Peter Schmetz, Baiden and senior midfielder Nic Ryan. McGlynn also returns after an injury plagued season.</p>\n<p>“Our defenders are looking really good,” David said. “We have seven good defenders who could start for any DI team in the nation.”</p>\n<p>Back in the goal will be senior goalkeeper Andre Grandt, who played every minute for the Gauchos last season and tallied 1.39 goals against average and 70 saves.</p>\n<p>Season highlights for UCSB include home matches against Harvard, Stanford and No. 2 UCLA. Up next for UCSB is a road game at Loyola Marymount on Sunday, Aug. 27 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/ucsb-sets-sights-ncaa-championship/","id":1653,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1652,1651,1650],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
