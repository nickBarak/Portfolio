now, Sorin would have an advisory role in the process, while Interim Title IX Coordinator Suzanne Taylor would have the final say on who UCSB’s representative is.</p>\n<p>By boycotting, Sorin will refuse to take part in the selection process for a new representative.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the association as a whole will not recognize any new board members until the board “acknowledges some structural changes need to be made and begin the process of making them,” said Raphael Chinchilla, GSA vice president for academic affairs.</p>\n<p>Selvidge resigned from her position as UCSB’s graduate student representative on the Title IX student advisory board in November following <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-graduate-rep-resigns-from-title-ix-student-advisory-board/\">disagreements</a> with the UC Office of the President (UCOP).</p>\n<p>These disagreements arose after the Nexus reported on <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/title-ix-policy-changes-explained-by-student-advisory-board-representative/\">Selvidge’s interpretation</a> of the new Title IX policy changes.</p>\n<p>She resigned a few days later, drafting a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Selvidge-Title-IX-Student-Advisory-Boar...signation-Letter-11-2-18-Google-Docs.pdf\">lengthy resignation letter</a> and releasing it to the public by way of the nowUCSB Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Selvidge also spoke heavily during Tuesday’s meeting, speaking to both her experience on the Title IX board as well as why she chose to resign.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, this is sort of a free speech issue,” Selvidge said. “If we cannot appoint our own independent representative… we can’t be certain that we’re actually going to get a representative who truly represents the graduate population, and that is concerning.”</p>\n<p>Sorin added to Selvidge’s points, claiming the board and UCOP have tried “to bully us into compliance with them, which I’m super not fucking down with.”</p>\n<p>“From our perspective and what happened with Jenny, [the Title IX Student Advisory Board] not only does not welcome dissent, but has actively tried to crush it,” Sorin said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“If you do not agree with what the Office of the President’s perspective is on the Title IX policy, and you are vocal about that, you will be removed.”</p>\n<p>The board, which was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">created in Nov. 2017</a>, aims to help clarify Title IX policies for students across the UC system.</p>\n<p>The board’s current head is Taylor, who took over following the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/first-uc-system-wide-title-ix-coordinator-resigns/\">resignation</a> of previous coordinator Kathleen Salvaty.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now the only UC without any representation on the board. UCSB has not had a say in board decisions for almost a month.</p>\n<p>“The university is continuing its search for UCSB representatives to serve on the Student Advisory Board,” Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Taylor forwarded the <em>Nexus</em>‘ request for comment to Doan.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 12]: The vote passed with one abstention, not zero.

Campus Democrats focused on registering voters and getting out the vote, while College Republicans created spaces for discussion and informed students of the issues.</p>\n<p>Both groups have been actively canvassing for their respective endorsed candidates.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats has devoted efforts to register voters, according to Campus Democrats President Aisha Khan.</p>\n<p>“Preparing for midterms is [about] maintaining that focus we’ve had since our beginning to educate young people about politics, politics locally, how they can get involved and why it’s important,” Khan, a third-year political science major, said.</p>\n<p>Since January 2018, Khan said Campus Democrats has registered 9,513 voters in the Isla Vista and UCSB communities.</p>\n<p>This includes the concentrated registration efforts during UCSB’s winter and spring quarters for the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats members tabled in the Arbor and the University Center almost every day from the beginning of the 2018-19 school year to register voters, Khan said.</p>\n<p>They also had stations around campus and I.V. on Oct. 22, the last day to register.</p>\n<p>College Republicans does not focus on registering voters and instead focuses on providing an open forum for discussion to students about the issues and candidates, according to College Republicans President Leslie Garcia.</p>\n<p>“In the past, we’ve hosted events for people to watch the presidential debates and the Republican candidate debates,” Garcia, a fourth-year Middle East studies and political science double major, said.</p>\n<p>“I think that the purpose of our [organization] is to create a space for discourse which isn’t really found on campus.”</p>\n<p>In addition to open general meetings, College Republicans hold public forum events throughout the year, such as the event held in the Hub on Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>The organization also holds speaking events and often dedicates large portions of time during those events for debate and questions.</p>\n<p>“Becoming engaged in a space where you are capable and there is an opportunity for you to debate your positions, that really does tend to [make] people [want] to be more knowledgeable and more involved in the political sphere,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating spaces for students to discuss and learn more about politics, both organizations have been canvassing for candidates aligned with their respective views.</p>\n<p>“One way that we have remained involved in the [upcoming] midterm elections is canvassing for Justin Fareed,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Fareed is a Republican Congressional candidate in the 24th congressional district. The district is currently represented by Salud Carbajal, who is endorsed by the Campus Democrats.</p>\n<p>The organization has been knocking on doors and speaking to voters in Goleta and Santa Maria leading up to the election.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also gotten involved with the No On Prop 10 campaign, so we’ve been making phone calls for them about two or three times a week, about five of our members each time,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>California Proposition 10 would repeal the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1506\">Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act</a>, a state law enacted in 1995 that places limitations on the power of city governments to control rent.</p>\n<p>Now that voter registration has ended, Campus Democrats has also doubled down on campaigning for local candidates and issues.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats “has been a volunteer for local Democratic campaigns” since its inception. The organization also has close ties with the campaigns of incumbent congressman Salud Carbajal and incumbent assemblywoman Monique Limón, according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“It’s about emphasizing the importance of local politics and the power that we have here locally,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>The organization has been canvassing for its slate of endorsed candidates as well as the passing of Measure G and California Proposition 10 by calling voters and going door-to-door in Santa Barbara, Isla Vista and Goleta.</p>\n<p>“People get exposure to what it’s like [to work on] on a real political campaign,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>Khan and Garcia both emphasized the importance of students exercising their right to vote.</p>\n<p>Garcia highlighted the importance of educated and informed voting as a key mission of College Republicans.</p>\n<p>She noted the influence of the political climate on conversations about the election with community members.</p>\n<p>“I think the majority of students are left-leaning, but I don’t think they’re so left-leaning that they’re completely shut down to discourse,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>“In the past year or two, there have been a lot of situations on campuses where events are shut down and students are harassed or assaulted because they are putting their political opinions out there. I don’t think that’s a thing that really happens here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>She said she believes elections such as the midterms can be overwhelming for first-time voters and individuals new to the U.S. political sphere.</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats also keeps the age of its intended audience in mind, and the organization’s main goal is “to educate and empower young people about politics,” according to Khan.</p>\n<p>“For a lot of us, we are really new to politics so it’s a unique opportunity to have a very powerful voice and [change] something when you are brand new to it,” Khan said.</p>\n<p>“There are not that many places in the country where young people’s votes are concentrated in an area and Isla Vista is one of those places. It makes a really big difference locally.”</p>\n<p><em>The 2018 midterm elections are on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

into this difficult decision,” Tri Delta’s national president, Kimberlee Di Fede Sullivan, said in an email sent out to members of the sorority Friday morning.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, it was made by the Executive Board, in concert with Gamma Theta’s chapter volunteers and Executive Office staff, with heavy hearts for all involved.”</p>\n<p>Sullivan cited a decline in membership numbers as the reason for shuttering operations.</p>\n<p>“Despite the hard work and dedication of the chapter and the continual support of volunteers and staff, Gamma Theta has not achieved quota since 2012 and currently remains significantly below total,” Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>According to the email, the suspension will last for a minimum of four years, but the chapter hopes to return “at a time that is mutually beneficial for Tri Delta and the university.”</p>\n<p>New members will be offered the option of becoming a sister but would be an unaffiliated collegiate member – an alumnus of the sorority – after June 14, 2019. New members are also allowed to join another sorority at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Students currently living in the house will continue to have housing for the rest of the academic year. All members will retain their membership privileges for the duration of the academic year if they uphold their financial and membership expectations.</p>\n<p>Tri Delta President Sarah Kinane did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 7, 6:03 p.m.]: This article was updated to include information about Kinane.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

For nearly a decade in the late 19th century, the land now occupied by UCSB hosted packs of miners picking and blasting at the rich asphalt deposit that runs along the Goleta coastline. The asphalt mined here was then used to pave streets and seal roofs in Goleta and other regions around the country.</p>\n<p>A Brief History of UCSB</p>\n<p>The beautifully landscaped campus students now call UCSB has passed through many hands over the centuries. The Chumash tribe originally lived on the land, and according to documentation from the Santa Barbara Museum Historical Society, even had permanent settlements near Cheadle Hall and the 217 entrance to UCSB. Later, under Mexican rule, portions of California lands, including Goleta, became available for purchase by private buyers. In the 1890s, a group of Englishmen started the Alcatraz Asphaltum Company and took over the land after it became windswept. The now filled-in mine shafts lie between the University Art Museum and the Faculty Club on campus. At the turn of the century, the mine was abandoned and the land went through several owners until 1942 when World War II led to the creation of a military base in the area. In 1950, the University of California Board of Regents purchased the base and in 1954 opened a liberal arts school known as the UC Santa Barbara College, a name that was later shortened to UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Getting the Shaft</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Mine operated from 1890 to1898 on the site of the present day UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>Senior Campus Planner Dennis Whelan said a fenced area blocks the filled-in entrance to the main vertical shaft.</p>\n<p>“They are generally located in the area between the Faculty Club, Hatlen Theater and the Arts Building,” Whelan said. “A fenced area is clearly visible from the service road between the Faculty Club and Hatlen Theater, now heavily overgrown with ivy. The horizontal shafts ran in several directions laterally around this vertical shaft.”</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Company leased the 400-acre tract of land from then-owner Mr. August Den. The mine employed 50 men ranging from local boys to experienced gold miners to quarrelsome transients. In one document from the Santa Barbara Museum Historical Society, historian Horace Sexton described the working conditions as long and arduous.</p>\n<p>“The men worked shifts of 10 hours each, two shifts making up the day’s work,” Sexton wrote. “The change-overs were at 7:00 a.m. and at 4:30 p.m. They came up for an hour at noon looking like blackened gnomes.”</p>\n<p>The mine paid $2.50 per day to the miners and $2 to the “muckers” who hauled dirt and shale out of the mine and loaded the asphalt onto cars sent to the main shaft. The miners and managers lived in bunkhouses and ate in a cook house on the site.</p>\n<p>When the mine first opened, no one managing had much experience, so the first shaft sunk crookedly some 200 ft. into the viscous asphalt itself, about 50 ft. from the lagoon.</p>\n<p>According to California Dept. of Conservation records, the deposit of asphalt was one of the purest examined, with the asphaltum being three to 12 ft. thick in some places. The walls were formed of slightly solidified clays, with distinct stratification.</p>\n<p>The asphalt would expand and harden when exposed to the air in the shaft, so it was decided a second shaft should stand in the shale alongside the vein of asphaltum as opposed into the vein itself. However, this second shaft was later deemed dangerous due to brackish water that kept seeping in and creating the potential for flooding in the shaft and skin infections.</p>\n<p>In his writings, Sexton stated that the mine was quite deep.</p>\n<p>“The horizontal tunnels, called ‘drifts,’ extended some 100 ft. to the ore body,” Sexton wrote. “These drifts were made every 50 vertical ft. to the final depth of the mine, some 550 ft.”</p>\n<p>The miners worked their way through the shafts by picking and blasting with dynamite. Besides the obvious blasting and seepage dangers, the mine was dangerous in other ways as well. Continuous streams of warm gas flowed from the asphaltum, and two men were even killed when their candles exploded in a pocket of gas. Their deaths established safety rules that had previously not existed. Cave-ins also occurred, injuring miners, and in one instance, impaling a worker on his own pick.</p>\n<p>At the height of production, the mine produced 60 tons of asphaltum daily. The product was transported all over the United States, and according to Sexton, it was “reliably reported that the streets of New Orleans were paved with asphaltum from the Goleta mine during those years.”</p>\n<p>The Alcatraz Asphaltum Company was later taken over by other companies and refined until 1898 when oil was deemed cheaper to produce and the Goleta mine was abandoned.</p>\n<p>Ross Brunetti, an engineer and geologist for the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, said many tar and asphalt mines existed in California until people discovered they could obtain oil from wells for much cheaper.</p>\n<p>“In 1901, the first major oil field opened and within a few years of that asphalt mining couldn’t pay out,” Brunetti said. “The whole state was so rich with oil from wells that mining asphalt was not economical until the energy crisis of the 1970s.”</p>\n<p>He said when the asphalt and tar mining industry collapsed, the workers oftentimes inadequately filled in the mines or simply left them open.</p>\n<p>“There was no requirement or incentive back then,” Brunetti said. “They’d just brush off their hands and walk away.”</p>\n<p>Mine for the Taking</p>\n<p>Today, students biking to class may have no knowledge of the sand-filled shafts that could rest below them, as the exact location of each filled-in shaft is indefinite.</p>\n<p>“Nobody knows precisely where they are,” Brunetti said.</p>\n<p>Whelan said a historic marker once stood before the ivy-covered square hedge near the Faculty Club. He also said the sign may have disappeared as the result of theft.</p>\n<p>“There was a historic site marker at the location,” Whelan said. “It is not there now.”</p>\n<p>While the asphalt mines on UCSB campus are filled, Brunetti said the state has many unmarked abandoned mines. When one is found, the Office of Mine Reclamation is informed and proceeds to fill it in for safety.</p>\n<p>“If it’s a vertical shaft, they will fill it in,” Brunetti said. “If it’s horizontal, they will put a grill over the entrance so bats can go in and out. This way it can remain a habitat.”</p>\n<p>Abandoned Mines Unit geologist Sarah Reeves said many factors affect the safety of abandoned mines. She said that if a mine were backfilled with sand and gravel versus clay, the mines are less stable.</p>\n<p>“It really depends on how extensive the underground workings are,” Reeves said. “The fill material can sometimes actually erode further into the mine and sink.”</p>\n<p>Though the Alcatraz Mines were probably filled with sand and dirt, Reeves said they are not likely to be dangerous because of the lack of evidence concerning sinkholes or moving foundations.</p>\n<p>“If you build something on an abandoned mine thinking it is safe because it is filled and pressure from the building makes the horizontal shafts move, the building can move, and that would be bad,” Reeves said. “It’s really a case by case basis.”</p>\n<p>Whelan said he is not worried about campus building foundations. He said UCSB takes mine shafts into consideration before constructing new buildings.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14963\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14963\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-31/mine-shafts-below-ucsb/","id":2185,"author":{"id":340,"name":"Lauren Crecelius"},"related":[2184,2183,2182],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
