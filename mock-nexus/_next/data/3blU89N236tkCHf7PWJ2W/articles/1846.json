During the demonstration, approximately 25 students dressed in all black laid down in the plaza — representing an oil spill — while speakers around them read poems and spoke about the dangers of oil drilling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her speech, Prufer referenced two Santa Barbara oil spills — the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/pipe-spills-21000-gallons-of-oil/\">2015 Plains pipeline spill at Refugio State Beach</a> and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, the latter of which launched the modern environmental movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early March demonstration was organized by CALPIRG to draw attention to the damage oil spills can cause. Governor Gavin Newsom </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/781040252/california-governor-cracks-down-on-fracking-requires-audits-and-scientific-revie\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introduced a moratorium</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2019 that prohibits new high-pressure cyclic steaming extraction wells, requires permits that will be closely examined for adherence to new environmental regulations and introduces new rules for public safety, according to Chloe Kerr-Stein, a first-year writing &amp; literature major who works with CALPIRG. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the organization hopes to convince Newsom to ban oil drilling completely; the group met with him at the beginning of winter quarter with the hope of convincing him to do just that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Newsom] wanted to see overwhelming student support for the issue. So that’s what we’re showing him with these emails, with the people who came out today,” Kerr-Stein said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Jagger, the organizer for CALPIRG’s 100% renewable energy campaign, said she believes now is the time to divest from fossil fuels and do away with oil and gas drilling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “In the time of climate catastrophe, it doesn’t make sense to further the issue by drilling for a resource that we know isn’t renewable and that is actively harming our planet,” she said. “We already have momentum towards a renewable energy future, and we should be continuing to shift towards greener energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her speech, Prufer also expressed concern that ExxonMobil </span><a href=\"https://keyt.com/news/local-politics/2019/11/13/santa-barbara-county-voters-oppose-exxonmobil-drilling-plan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to restart three oil rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want to revive the threat of another catastrophic oil spill on our coast and in order to restart these platforms, they want to truck up to 70 truckloads of oil per day on California’s coast,” she said. “They want to do this for several years while they wait for Plains, the company that spilled in the first place, to rebuild that dirty pipeline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to California’s position as one of the leading states in environmentalism, Kerr-Stein stressed the importance of Californians taking action for environmental justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“California is a really big player in just what other states do,” Kerr-Stein said. “One state tries something out, everyone sees that and they’re like, ‘Oh, it works for them.’ And then more states adopt it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prufer said she encouraged students to spread the word on social media, reach out to Gov. Newsom and urge the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to prevent offshore oil drilling in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagger added that she believes students “need to act quickly” to help prevent any further damage from climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re already seeing the effects of climate change in fires raging across the Amazon, the Arctic, central Africa and Australia. We’re seeing continually shrinking sea ice and we’re also seeing intensifying weather events like Hurricane Dorian, which was the most powerful hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas,” Jagger said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

This decline mainly affected the UC campuses of Davis, Los Angeles, Merced, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, other UC campuses such as Berkeley and San Diego experienced a relatively modest increase, particularly UC Irvine, with a boost from 95,556 in 2019 to 97,916 in 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, freshmen applications decreased to 90,947, compared to 93,423 in 2019; the number of California and international applications fell, while out-of-state applications experienced a minor increase of 453, according to the data. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, transfer applications rose from 41,120 in 2019 to 43,063 in 2020, a 4.8% rise over 2018, with every single UC campus experiencing this growth. In particular, the amount of transfer students applying to UCSB in 2020 increased in California and out-of-state categories, while the international category slightly dipped. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lisa Przekop, UCSB director of Admissions, explained in an email that the decline of freshman applications is a nationwide trend, and that “some shifts may be due to the anticipated decline in the actual number of high school graduates in this age group (general population decline).” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Przekop added that the shifts may also be due to the cost of college becoming a major concern to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a decrease in the number of applications, Przekop said the academic profile of this year’s applicants improved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The academic profile of our freshman applicant pool actually increased (higher GPA and test scores).
