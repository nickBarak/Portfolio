But a win won’t come easy today, as the Gauchos host the best team in the Big West in Sacramento State.</p>\n<p>“We expect a battle against Sac State,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “They’re in first place and they’re there for a reason. We know if we want to do anything this season, we have to beat these guys.”</p>\n<p>The Hornets hold a 7-4-2 overall record and are undefeated in the Big West at 4-0-1. Santa Barbara sits in a tie for third place with Cal Poly with an 8-2-3 overall and a 2-2-1 conference record. Five points out of second place in the North Division, the Gauchos see this as a must-win game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We have to come out with a win,” Ryan said. “There’s 12 points left [in conference] and we’re six points behind Sac State. We feel we can definitely make up some ground on Tuesday.”</p>\n<p>The matchup against Sac State opens up a four game home stand for UCSB. With a 3-1-1 record at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos will look to take advantage of playing in front of a home crowd.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing at home, so we have the advantage,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “We’re coming off two losses, so we’re fired up and we don’t want to repeat those mistakes.”</p>\n<p>For this game, one thing is on the mind of the UCSB squad: scoring goals. Despite ranking second in shots with 16.83 per game and first in goals per game with 2.08, the Gauchos have been shut out in three of their last four games, finding the back of the net just once in that span.</p>\n<p>“No matter what happens, we have to put goals in the net,” Baiden said. “That’s our motive. We’re going to do everything we can to increase our goal-scoring opportunities.”</p>\n<p>In Big West games, the Hornets are second from the bottom in shots, taking just 12.75 per game, but take advantage of their opportunities. The team ranks second in goals per game with 1.5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will once again need to break through a tough defense to score. Sac State allows just .5 goals per game, second in the Big West. Anchoring the Hornet defense is senior goalkeeper Bryan Oliver, who has the best save percentage in the league at 82.9 percent and leads the Big West in saves with 5.73 per contest.</p>\n<p>“I think [the key] has to be combination play … being calm and being patient,” Ryan said. “We’re not a team that plays the ball over the top, so I think we just need to play the way we know best … pass and get behind the defense that way.”</p>\n<p>On the other end of the pitch is UCSB’s sophomore keeper Austin Mansker. Mansker leads the conference with a .73 goals against average. With two of the best keepers in the Big West on display, offensive execution may determine the outcome.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Hornets will look to three key players: midfielders Chris Sandoval, senior and Gabe Silveira, junior, who have each scored four goals on the year, as well as junior forward Isaac Ikyurav, who has tallied three goals and four assists.</p>\n<p>Kickoff on Tuesday against Sac State is set for 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48169\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-16/gauchos-host-big-west-leader-sac-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48169\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-16/gauchos-host-big-west-leader-sac-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-16/gauchos-host-big-west-leader-sac-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-16/gauchos-host-big-west-leader-sac-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-16/gauchos-host-big-west-leader-sac-state/","id":1636,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1635,1634,1633],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gankema Twins: UCSB’s Double Trouble","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Entering the season as one of the youngest teams in the Big West, the UCSB women’s soccer team has matured into a serious contender this year thanks in large part to the veteran play of two junior G...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Entering the season as one of the youngest teams in the Big West, the UCSB women’s soccer team has matured into a serious contender this year thanks in large part to the veteran play of two junior Gauchos in the backline.

They showed off their footwork at UCSB’s summer soccer camp and impressed the coaching staff with their intelligence and skill.</p>\n<p>“We saw them play a few times, then they came to our summer camp and it was at that camp that they convinced us that we needed to go after them,” Stumpf said. “They’re really intelligent soccer players, very skilled soccer players. They’re not the most imposing players on the face of the planet, but they maximize what they do have.”</p>\n<p>Despite winning various championships at the club level together and each winning various awards and accolades, success was not always the case for the Gankema sisters. Each struggled with assimilating to their individual roles early in their collegiate careers. In the first two seasons, both players combined for a total of only one start.</p>\n<p>“Before we became freshmen, we played every single minute of every single game. We were starters, we were the best in the team,” Paige said. “But once you come here, you’re trying to compete with other girls that are the best on the team. So it’s just hard to be a full-time player and being a superstar in the club team, and then coming in and not being able to play and not starting.”</p>\n<p>Things were especially difficult for Lindsay, who despite playing in 12 games last season, had to see Paige on the sideline for most of the season as she played in only one game in 2011.</p>\n<p>“It was difficult because our whole lives, we always played exactly at the same time, we played the whole game,” Lindsay said. “It was different to see [Paige] out when I played, and I felt bad, but coaches, in the end, decide.”</p>\n<p>Patience and persistence paid off for both sisters as their hard work in practice was finally recognized at the start of this season and has led to an increase in playing time for the two Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I think they’ve started or played in almost every game, so it’s great for them; they put in their time on the bench doing almost everything right,” Stumpf said. “Now their opportunity arises and I think they’re grabbing that opportunity with two hands and holding on. They are mentally tough and physically tough, so I’m really kind of proud of kids like that.”</p>\n<p>Now, having the opportunity to play on the field at the same time once again, the two players have helped the defense with their established chemistry and sixth sense of knowing where the other sister is on the field at all times.</p>\n<p>“We just work well together, we kind of know exactly how each other plays, what to expect from each other, where I’m going to go, where she’s going to go,” Paige said. “We can kind of tell beforehand what’s going to happen — if she’s going to win the ball, that kind of thing. It’s fun getting to play with your sister, there’s nothing better than that.”</p>\n<p>Despite being born only 17 minutes apart — Lindsay being the oldest — you will be hard-pressed to find any sibling rivalry existing between the two defenders, as they are each other’s biggest supporters on and off the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re always there for each other, so I would say [our relationship] is the same off and on the field,” Lindsay said. “We’re best friends. I consider her more my friend than my sister because we’re always together and we’re always hanging out; we do everything together.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/","id":1633,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1632,1631,1630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels North to Take on UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After suffering its first loss of the season last weekend to Cal State Northridge, the No. 8 UCSB men’s soccer team will look to rebound in a critical matchup Saturday against UC Davis. “We will l...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After suffering its first loss of the season last weekend to Cal State Northridge, the No. 8 UCSB men’s soccer team will look to rebound in a critical matchup Saturday against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“We will look at [the Northridge] game and that loss and use it as motivation,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Saturday and every game the rest of the way become games we have to win.

Two teams move on in the north, so it’s a huge game.”</p>\n<p>Davis enters the game on a three-game win streak and seems to have finally found its stride. In the last four conference games, the Aggies have scored six goals, good enough for second in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Davis is always a tough battle,” Ryan said. “They play with a lot of energy and [recently] they’ve been doing well scoring goals. They’re a team we can’t take lightly.”</p>\n<p>While the Aggies won’t be found atop the rankings in virtually any Big West category, the team succeeds with its solid defense.</p>\n<p>“They’re a good team defensively,” Ryan said. “They work for each other. They stay in and stay in and then get that one goal and that’s all they need.”</p>\n<p>All season UCSB has proven that its offense is strong and potent, ranking first in goals per game with 2.08 and second in shots per game with 16.83, but the Gauchos have struggled recently with giving up the first goal. In its last two matches, Santa Barbara has allowed the opponent to get on the score sheet first.</p>\n<p>“The key [for us] will be finding the back of the net,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “We’ve been struggling to get our forwards going, so [getting] on the score sheet early is a big key.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Ryan has stepped up to lead the attack for the Gauchos. Ryan is tied for second in the Big West in points with 13 (six goals and one assist) as well as game winning goals with four. Ryan’s last example of late game heroics came against UC Irvine last Friday when Ryan scored the golden goal in double overtime with 24 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“[Ryan’s] picking up the slack, but we need production from our forwards right now,” Vom Steeg said. “We need Dion, Javier, and Ema</p>\n<p>to score. That hasn’t happened the last couple weekends. Nic should be third or so on our team in scoring.”</p>\n<p>In order to find that offensive rhythm again, the Gauchos will work on simply focusing and taking advantage of their chances.</p>\n<p>“You saw against Northridge and Irvine that we were playing well and got some very good looks on goal and we didn’t put it on frame,” Vom Steeg said. “The next thing you know, on their first or second shot, they found the back of the net. The key for us is that when we are playing well, that we get a goal. If you don’t, you let the other team have confidence.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. at Aggie Soccer Field.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48130\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/ucsb-travels-north-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48130\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/ucsb-travels-north-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/ucsb-travels-north-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/ucsb-travels-north-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/ucsb-travels-north-uc-davis/","id":1634,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1633,1632,1631],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Home Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final home games of the regular season, the UCSB women’s soccer team defeated the University of Hawaii 1-0 before losing a close contest to Cal State Northridge by a 1-0 margin.

With the match still even heading into the last 10 minutes of regulation, the game seemed to be heading into overtime until CSUN’s freshman midfielder Taylor Hobson was able to exploit the backline and score from 10 yards out, giving Cal State Northridge the 1-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“It was very even — a lot of heart and passion. We just couldn’t capitalize on our opportunities,” junior goalkeeper Makenna Henry said. “This loss is just like the previous losses we have had this season. It’s all on us, we lost our focus defensively and we got caught.”</p>\n<p>UCSB earned its first conference win Friday against Hawaii on Senior Night.
