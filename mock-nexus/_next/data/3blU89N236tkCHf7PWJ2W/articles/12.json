Born out of necessity, the Intramural team had only a few weeks to plan, organize and execute the concept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the time constraints, Intramural ESports only featured three different games: Rocket League, FIFA 20 and NBA 2K20. With Rocket League, each participant had the option to play in a 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3 league. In each sport, players were grouped into different divisions based on their skill level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mikal de Wit — a Spring 2020 graduate and Recreation Center employee who helped Escobedo plan Intramural ESports — participated in all three variations of Rocket League and noted the enthusiasm from other participants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was surprised at how many people had signed up; we had close to 100 people in just Rocket League,” de Wit said. “As a [Rocket League] player, I thought it was really cool to add something to the game and have something to play towards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In each division, de Wit played two series for a three-week period, with each series consisting of a best-two-out-of-three format. Between setting up the game with his opponent and breaks within the game, de Wit estimated that each Rocket League series took about half an hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the regular season, players who qualified for the playoffs faced off in a best-of-five series, with a final best-of-seven series to determine the champion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In my experience, the games were competitive but very friendly,” de Wit said. “ The format was cool because</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you got to play against [playoff] opponents during the regular season, so in the finals, you already played them and you’re hoping to get the win this time around in the postseason.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it started as an emergency backup plan, the inaugural Intramural ESports featured hundreds of participants and allowed the Intramural program to engage with students who wouldn’t normally participate in intramural sports, according to Escobedo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large part of the Department of Recreation’s mission and values is being student-focused,” Escobedo said. “As long as our students continue to show that they’re substantially interested in ESports, Intramural will enjoy growing our ESports offerings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, Escobedo and the team are committed to expanding and improving upon their current ESports program. This summer, they are working with Francisco Rodriguez — the ESports and Outreach Officer for Gaucho Gaming — to create a much broader program for the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB is one of the few UCs that’s lacked any school-backing Esports program,” Rodriguez said. “ Since I transferred [in 2018], I’ve been working on creating a program, and now that they see that ESports is extremely viable, we are having a series of meetings to create an ESports Program at UCSB.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the logistics of that program are yet to be determined, it seems clear that Intramural ESports will return in the fall with more game offerings for students to choose from. Despite a pre-COVID reluctance, the Intramural team seems to have embraced ESports— and, in some ways, embraced the future of sports and gaming.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2669.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/brandon-victor/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Brandon Victor</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Brandon Victor serves as a 2020-2021 sports editor.

That marks the 23</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rd</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> time this year UCSB has earned double-digit hits in a game owning a record of 20-3 in those contests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith also bumped his hit streak to nine games which has also seen the junior total 10 RBI’s in that stretch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the first inning was a bit of trouble for the Gauchos and left-handed pitcher Jorge Arellano Jr. After getting the leadoff man to fly out, the redshirt freshman allowed two singles and walked the next two batters giving St. Mary’s a 1-0 lead with the bases juiced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arellano Jr. worked his way around the jam, striking out the next batter and forcing the last one to pop out to only go down 1-0 to start.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the bottom of the second, sophomore Andrew Martinez tied the game at 1-1 with a solo shot to left center. He would finish the day going 2-4.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tie game would not last long, however, as in the top of the third, junior Kevin Milam hit his seventh homer of the year to give SMC a one-run lead again. Milam has been on a tear for the Gaels lately as he has homered in two straight now and has gone 6-16 (.375) in his last five contests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sides would then trade scoreless innings until Smith’s big fly in the sixth which was made possible after catcher Eric Yang was hit by a pitch and Thomas Rowan lined a double earlier in the frame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went 2-4 in this contest legging out another triple this season pushing his total to eight on the year, just one off the single-season record. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That last triple I hit, even if I was out I was going to go for it. You have to take chances and that record is in the back of my mind and it is something I want to break,” Smith said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Smith’s home run really did prove to be the difference as St. Mary’s pulled within one in the eighth after an RBI single from sophomore outfielder Joe Vranesh but never managed to tie or take the lead again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, UCSB stretched its lead in the bottom half of the eighth out to 6-3 following a two-run single from junior Tevin Mitchell. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln tossed the final 1.1 innings of the game — impressively striking out all four batters he faced — to earn his 13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> save of the year. The Moreno Valley, Calif. native is one save away from tying the save single-season program record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior righty Connor Dand picked up the win improving to 3-0 this year after coming in relief for Arellano Jr and tossing 2.1 scoreless innings. He allowed just one hit and struck out two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will begin a three-game series against LBSU at 3 p.m. Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UC President Janet Napolitano, follows the path of a number of institutions across the country that have gone </span><a

As the largest university system in the nation to eliminate the test, the UC’s decision will likely have a ripple effect across the country, according to the Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 2025 onward, California applicants will be judged by a new testing standard to assess knowledge that “better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values,” Napolitano’s report read. No decision has been made yet for out-of-state and international students, who might continue using the SAT and ACT or be judged by the UC’s future standardized test assessment, the details of which have yet to be determined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a new test has not been implemented by 2025, the testing requirement for California students will be eliminated altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to move in a careful and studied way to the new future for the University … a better test should be what we aim for in California,” Napolitano told the Regents, saying one goal in the creation of a new test is to help strengthen college preparedness in California high schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also want to work …  to analyze and drill down into factors that contribute to disproportionate representation, or rather underrepresentation, of students from underserved communities in our population. We are a public university after all,” Napolitano told the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and 2022 application cycles, the SAT and ACT will be optional. This is partially due to the cancellation of tests due to the coronavirus but extends the optional period to two years instead of the original one-year extension as approved by the Regents in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2023 and 2024 application cycles, admissions will be “test blind.” Students may submit an SAT or ACT score for reasons other than admissions, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC, according to Napolitano’s recommendation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano acknowledged that the new testing assessment might draw on other standardized tests. In her comments, she mentioned that the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states, could be fitted for college admission testing in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was debate among the regents over whether to continue use of the ACT and SAT while a new test was in the works, a similar line of reasoning to that of the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, where the task force recommended keeping the ACT and SAT in place until a replacement test is finalized.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/06/groups-demand-university-california-stop-using-satact-scores-admissions-alleging-tests-discriminate-against-underprivileged-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/is-sat-test-going-down-at-uc-several-uc-regents-express-deep-skepticism-over-use-in-admissions-process\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the years have shared the attitude that both income and race are indicators of success on standardized tests, with an industry developing around years-long preparation and some beginning as early as middle school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the UC to eliminate the test in admissions.

That could be an issue against UC Davis, whose record and small size make them easy to overlook.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there’s no easy way to avoid overconfidence, the Gauchos have just the right tool to take advantage of the Aggies’ short stature: sophomore big-man Amadou Sow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sow, who earned Big West Player of the Week honors for his team-leading performances in UCSB’s wins over Hawai’i and UC Irvine last week, is on a roll and ready to overwhelm UC Davis. The Aggies are 10-15 overall this season and 4-5 in the Big West and have exactly one player over 6’3” who plays more than 20 minutes per game.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine recently pulled off a season sweep of UC Davis and provided UCSB with a blueprint on how to do so. The Anteaters’ size was too much for the Aggies, whom they outscored 74-30 in the paint and outrebounded by a combined total of 25 rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sow will get his chance to do similar damage on Thursday night in Davis. The sophomore is coming off of a dominant week that saw him set a career high for points with 30 in the Hawai’i game and then followed that up with a 21-point, 10-rebound performance against UC Irvine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Amadou has done a great job,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “He’s had some poor basketball games, and he’s done an amazing job of recovering, and I’m really happy for him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis’ lack of size presents opportunities not just for the Gaucho big men, but for the guards as well. Senior Max Heidegger and junior JaQuori McLaughlin both excel at getting inside and finishing at the rim, and they should have plenty of opportunities to do so against an Aggie team that blocks a Big West-worst 1.8 shots a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they don’t block very many shots, UCD does boast some of the quickest hands on the West Coast. The Aggies average 6.1 steals per game this season and have forced a conference-best 14.2 turnovers per game in conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Davis is number one in the conference at forcing turnovers,” Pasternack said. “That’s their best thing they do. They really do a great job of defending the three and forcing turnovers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other end of the court, UC Davis tends to live and die by the 3-pointer. The Aggies are shooting a stunning 40.1% from 3-point land in conference play, and they lead the Big West with 79 made 3-pointers against conference opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Matchups are very hard [against UC Davis],” Pasternack said. “They’re very small, and they can really shoot the ball. We’re going to be challenged to defend the three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Stefan Gonzalez isn’t just UCD’s top sniper; he’s one of the best shooters in the country. Gonzalez is third in the NCAA with a .479 3-point field goal percentage and makes about three 3-pointers a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Gonzalez is clicking, and he has been in pretty much every game this season, there’s not much the opposing team can do but relentlessly deny him the ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez’s fellow senior guard Joe Mooney is UC Davis’ leading scorer with 13.2 points per game, although he’s scored in the single digits in five of his last six games. Freshman point guard Ezra Manjon has stepped up instead with 15.4 points per game in Big West play while averaging 4.2 assists per game over that same time span.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies have won two of their last three games, with the most recent win an 87-81 victory over Cal State Fullerton that saw sophomore forward Caleb Fuller explode for a career-high 23 points. UCD’s 4-5 conference record is somewhat middling but is just a game back of UCSB for third place in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Gauchos, the task on Thursday evening will be to keep the Aggies from doing too much damage from behind the 3-point line and to stay steady after three wins in a row. The winning streak and the feeling of beating two of the Big West’s best in Hawai’i and UC Irvine is undoubtedly intoxicating, but UC Davis won’t be forgiving if UCSB gets too cocky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every single game has a different life of its own,” Pasternack said. “We just have to keep playing team basketball and sharing the basketball and getting assists and defending.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are far from a Goliath, even with three wins in a row, but they’d still do well to follow that prescription when they take on the David-sized UC Davis team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB plays UC Davis in Davis on Thursday at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92758\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/red-hot-gauchos-look-to-extend-win-streak-against-aggies/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92758\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/red-hot-gauchos-look-to-extend-win-streak-against-aggies/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/red-hot-gauchos-look-to-extend-win-streak-against-aggies/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/red-hot-gauchos-look-to-extend-win-streak-against-aggies/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/red-hot-gauchos-look-to-extend-win-streak-against-aggies/","id":11,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[10,9,8],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
