CSUN is currently 2-2 and is fourth in the conference standings after defeating UC Riverside and Cal Poly, but losing to Long Beach State 6-1 and CSU Fullerton 5-2.</p>\n<p>Matador standout junior Mickey Hsu is leading the team in wins at 8-7 overall in singles play with all but one of those matches at the first slot. Hsu also is part of CSUN’s best doubles pair along with junior Kristen Poei. Together, they have a 6-8 record in doubles with all the matches played at the one.</p>\n<p>Following the Northridge matchup, the Gauchos will play on Saturday against defending Big West champs Long Beach State. The 49ers are currently tied for first with Cal State Fullerton in the Big West, but have played two more games than UCSB so far.</p>\n<p>The Niners are 4-0 in conference and have been playing well all year long, as evident with their 11-4 overall record. Long Beach has won eight of its last 10, losing only to No. 3 North Carolina State and No. 9 Pepperdine.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, this matchup will be a tough contest for both sides, as both teams are only separated by two spots in the national rankings. Even though LBSU boasts a 10-2 record at home, the 49ers are 1-2 away from Long Beach.</p>\n<p>Junior Maeva Razakasoa has reached the no. 60 slot on the national rankings for singles, moving up six places from a week ago. The French native has accumulated an 11-3 dual record all at the one, and has won nine of her last 10 played.</p>\n<p>She is 2-2 against nationally ranked singles players. Razakasoa also is part of a tough doubles team alongside junior Julie Gerrard; together they both are 9-2, winning four straight in doubles, but have not beaten any nationally ranked doubles pair.</p>\n<p>Long Beach also has a nationally ranked doubles duo at the no. 36 spot consisting of juniors Laura Eales and Hayley Thompson. Together, they are 8-2 in duals as a pair with a record of 2-1 against other ranked opposition.</p>\n<p>It will undoubtedly be an interesting matchup between No. 36 and No. 11 in doubles, Gauchos junior Stefani Stojic and sophomore Palina Dubavets.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will wrap up the weekend against UC Riverside. The Highlanders have struggled this season to find a consistent winning formula as they currently are riding a five-game losing streak with a 3-10 overall record and 0-4 start in conference play.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams played against each other was last year, and it did not go well for UCR as it was swept by UCSB 7-0. Sophomores Lou Adler and Natalie Da Silveira will hope to continue last year’s newfound success. Adler and Da Silveira managed a doubles win, and the young Brazilian earned a singles victory at the one slot last time they played.</p>\n<p>This weekend will be busy for UCSB as it will play against Big West Conference rivals Friday against Northridge at 2:30 p.m., Saturday against Long Beach State 11 a.m. and Sunday versus UC Riverside at 10 a.m., with all games at the Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 1, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

At the end of the four-hour contest, Boise State found themselves on top 4-3 with a walk-off victory on court four.</p>\n<p>The match started in Santa Barbara’s favor as it took the doubles point with wins from some of the team’s veteran players on courts one and three. Junior co-captain Morgan Mays and senior Andrew Riminton were the first off with a dominant 6-2 win on court three.</p>\n<p>The nation’s No. 34 doubles team of seniors Nathan Eshmade and Miles Seemann would seal the doubles point and a 1-0 lead for the Gauchos with a close victory of 7-5 on court one.</p>\n<p>Heading into singles play the Gauchos would continue their success as they built upon their lead with two wins on the lower courts. Sophomore Cody Rakela and freshman Oliver Sec both captured straight set sweeps over their opponents on courts five and six, respectively, to start the singles round.</p>\n<p>These two wins put the Gauchos up 3-0 over the Broncos and Santa Barbara would need just one more match to clinch the overall win.</p>\n<p>With their backs against the wall, the Broncos would grind out three straight singles wins on the upper courts to tie the match at 3-3.</p>\n<p>All three wins for Boise State were decided in tiebreakers and extra sets as the team outlasted the Gauchos. With the score tied, the decider would fall on court four where freshman Anders Holm of Santa Barbara faced Boise’s freshman Kyle Butters.</p>\n<p>This final freshman bout would go to three sets, all of which were played in full to the tiebreaker in the end. Holm won the first set with a 7-3 victory in the break, but Butters captured the second in the break 7-5.</p>\n<p>Carrying his momentum from the second, the first year Bronco sealed the match and the upset for his team defeating Holm 6-7(3-7), 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-3) overall. His win notched the final score at 4-3 in favor of Boise State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would look to its next match on the road Friday afternoon at Loyola Marymount and in the end found the same results as the team’s previous heartbreak with Boise State. In Los Angeles, the Gauchos looked to bounce back but again were downed by one point as the Lions won 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara would again start out the match with a 1-0 lead as it took the doubles point with wins on courts one and three. This was the sixth straight time that the Gauchos captured the doubles round in dual match play.</p>\n<p>The No. 34 team of Eshmade and Seemann defeated its opponents 6-2 on court one and the duo of Mays and Riminton would seal the point with a 6-4 win on three. It has now been 10 matches since Eshmade’s and Seemann’s last doubles loss and they have registered eight wins over that time.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued its success early in the singles round winning two of the first three completed matches.</p>\n<p>Rakela added another win on court five, giving him his fifth straight, as he took a one-sided victory of 6-1, 6-2 only dropping three total games in his sweep. After dropping a match on court six, Eshmade added a singles win for his team in sweeping fashion on court one.</p>\n<p>The senior player took a 7-6(7-3), 6-2 win that put the Gauchos up 3-1. Santa Barbara would once again look for just one more singles win to clinch.</p>\n<p>Trailing by two in front of their home crowd, the Lions would rally winning the next three singles matches to give them the overall win over the Gauchos 4-3.</p>\n<p>The final two matches on courts two and three came down to three sets and LMU was able to outlast Santa Barbara, as the nation’s No. 51 team took its second straight loss by one point in walk-off fashion. UCSB would return home to face No. 47 Denver on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The match with the Pioneers was all too similar for the Gauchos, but this time it would be Santa Barbara that came out on top 4-3. This win snapped the team’s two-match skid and could not have been timelier versus a ranked opponent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got out to a slow start on Easter as they dropped the doubles point falling on courts one and three. The freshman squad of Holm and Nicolas Moreno de Alboran would capture the team’s only doubles win with a 6-4 outing on court two.</p>\n<p>Down 1-0, Santa Barbara would need four singles wins to avoid dropping its third straight dual match.</p>\n<p>The Pioneers claimed the first singles match to build upon their lead, but the Gauchos would answer back winning three straight matches on the lower courts to take the late lead, 3-2.</p>\n<p>Rakela and Sec added straight set wins of 7-5, 7-5 and 7-5, 6-3, respectively on the bottom two courts and Holm would give his team the lead with a 6-2, 1-6, 6-2 win on court four.</p>\n<p>For the third straight time, the Gauchos would look for just one more win in singles play. They turned to courts two and three, where Moreno de Alboran and Mays both played into a third set.</p>\n<p>After dropping the second set on court three, Mays was cold in the start of the third falling behind his opponent 4-1.</p>\n<p>Despite trailing, the team’s co-captain would rise winning five straight games to seal both his match and a 4-2 overall win for Santa Barbara, ending its short losing streak. The Pioneers would end the match taking a court two win to set the final score at 4-3 in UCSB’s favor.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will remain at home and will open up Big West Conference play with two matches on the weekend. They will face Hawaii on Friday at 10 a.m. and UC Irvine on Sunday at 2 p.m. Both matches will be held at the Rec Cen Courts.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69151\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69151\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-27/no-51-ucsb-avoids-sweep-in-non-conference-finale/","id":101,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[100,99,98],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 49 UCSB Kicksoff Conference Schedule at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MTennis_vsPacific-20160227-DustinHarris-3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Recently reclaiming its spot in the national rankings, the No. 49 UCSB men's tennis team will welcome Hawaii this Friday and UCI on Saturday to begin conference play.

The Anteaters downed the Monarchs quickly by a score of 4-0 back in late January.</p>\n<p>Following its one-sided victory, UCI fell to a couple of tough ranked opponents, but has since bounced back and now ride a seven-match win streak.</p>\n<p>Much of Irvine’s late success has been in part to its number one singles player, sophomore Sebastian Heim, who is the highest ranked singles player in the Big West Conference at No. 78.</p>\n<p>Heim is 10-2 overall in dual match play and is 1-1 against other ranked players having played all 12 matches on court one for his team. The sophomore has taken all but one of his wins in straight set sweeps and ranked as high as No. 55 just a few weeks ago. He will likely match up with Eshmade in Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Gauchos’ recent return to the national standings of No. 49 in the nation is the best in the Big West. The team also sports the highest ranked doubles team in the conference as Eshmade and his partner Miles Seemann currently stand at No. 34</p>\n<p>The duo has won eight of its last nine finishes and will look to give Santa Barbara an early jump in this weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>“The consistent work ethic, listening to the coaching staff, supporting each other and everyone doing their part for the team will ultimately give us the best chance to take out the Big West,” Eshmade explained. “Last year, we had a great support group and an incredible amount of team chemistry. This year it is even better, so I’m excited to see what unfolds.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will start their match on Friday at 10 a.m. with Hawaii and at 2 p.m. on Sunday with UC Irvine. Both matches are set to be held at UCSB’s Rec Cen Courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 1, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/no-49-ucsb-to-open-big-west-schedule-friday-vs-hawaii-play-uci-saturday/","id":103,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[102,101,100],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 65 Gauchos Defeat CSUN and UCR, Lose 4-3 to No. 67 LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WTennisVSCSUN-04012016-JennyLuo-11-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its last home matches of the season, the No. 65 UCSB women's tennis team managed to improve to 4-1 in Big West play with victories over CSUN and UCR despite being edged by No. 67 Long Beach State.

The matadors were 2-2 in the Big West prior to Friday’s match. UCSB did not have an easy time against CSUN but still managed to win 4-3.</p>\n<p>“Northridge is a tricky team to play,” Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. “(CSUN) came in playing pretty well and we started slow but we were able to win the match.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started the month losing the opening doubles point for the first time since dropping to Oregon in Hawaii. No. 16 in doubles Sophomore Palina Dubavets and junior Stefani Stojic lost to juniors Mickey Hsu and Kristen Poei 6-4.</p>\n<p>Sophomores Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson managed to give the Gauchos a fighting chance by beating sophomore Kiryang Kim and junior Mari Taslagyan 6-2.</p>\n<p>With the doubles point up for grabs, it was between junior Melissa Baker and freshman Stephanie Yamada on one side of the net against the Matadors’ junior Vivian Lin and freshman Skyla Alcon.</p>\n<p>In true Big West fashion, the drama did not end there, but rather continued in a back and forth contest. The doubles match gave a glimpse of how the contest would conclude with a narrow ending.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the game ended in favor for Northridge as it squeaked by with the win to grant CSUN its first point of the day, winning by a score of 7-6.</p>\n<p>However, the remaining games went back and forth similar to the last doubles set. The first singles match between Stefani Stojic and Kirsten Poei on court three went fairly quickly as Stojic only conceded one point in two sets, winning 6-1, 6-0.</p>\n<p>The next singles match also went in favor of the Gauchos as Dubavets defeated Vivian Lin on court two by scores of 6-2 and 6-1 to hand the Gauchos a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>In response, Northridge’s Alcon managed to tie the match by overcoming UCSB’s Atanasson 6-4 in the first set and 6-2 in the second. With the score knotted at 2-2, the next two events went resulted in a point for each team, leaving the match to be decided by the two players on court six.</p>\n<p>Juniors Jaimee Gilbertson and Mari Taslagyan went all three sets in an intense contest between the then top three teams in the conference.</p>\n<p>Taslagyan won the first set 7-5 but dropped the next two sets. The second finished 7-6(5) and the third 6-4 all in favor of Gilbertson who extended her single’s dual record to 7-6. The match ended with a 4-3 win for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning’s match between reigning Big West Conference champion, No. 67 Long Beach State, and runner up UCSB was a lot closer than any of last year’s encounters were.</p>\n<p>Last season when the two teams met, the 49ers won 6-1 and beat the Gauchos in the conference final 4-1. This time around, the 49ers managed to edge UCSB for a 4-3 victory.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to win, even though we lost, we feel pretty good on our chances against Long Beach,” Thibodeau said. “We didn’t play well in doubles, lost at five and six. [But], we can surely win next time if we play better at doubles and better at the five and six we can do pretty well. It was still positive to see we lost 4-3. We still have lots of room to improve and this is the closest we have been to beating them”.</p>\n<p>UCSB started slow once again, losing the doubles point quickly having two of the three matches end with a score of 6-2 while the match in which Dubavets and Stojic participated in went unfinished.</p>\n<p>However, as soon as the singles portion of the match commenced, Santa Barbara demonstrated its capability to compete against the 49ers as the Gauchos won three straight to go up 3-1 against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>But, the 49ers proved why they were the defending champs as they went on to win three straight in singles to clinch a 4-3 win.</p>\n<p>After another narrow defeat, the Gauchos had one day to turnaround and face one of the weaker Big West Conference opponents in UC Riverside. Head coach Simon Thibodeau managed to rest a few of his starters as the Gauchos were still able to defeat the Highlanders 7-0.</p>\n<p>This weekend helped to foreshadow the competitive race set to take place in the Big West standings as Long Beach State remain atop of the conference with its 6-0 standing and UCSB is at third with its 4-1 record behind another conference undefeated in CSU Fullerton. Fullerton has yet to face Long Beach or Santa Barbara this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-04/no-65-gauchos-defeat-csun-and-ucr-lose-4-3-to-no-67-lbsu/","id":102,"author":{"id":285,"name":"Xavier Cardenas"},"related":[101,100,99],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
