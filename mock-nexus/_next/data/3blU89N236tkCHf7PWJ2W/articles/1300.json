Senior forward Shaelan Murison and sophomore defender Lauren Hess scored 1 goal each for the ‘Chos. After grabbing a 2-0 lead, UCSB gave up 2 straight goals that were only 42 seconds apart in the 80th minute of the matchup. The game would end in a tie as neither team was able to score in the overtime periods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matadors, 11-7-3, were looking to pick up their 12th win of the season as well as their second win against the Gauchos. Cal State Northridge is led by junior redshift forward Bethany Fitzsimmons who has 6 goals and 2 assists on the season. On the defensive side of the field, sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Delgado anchors the defense as she has posted an impressive 76 saves along with a save percentage of 80%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murison paced the Gauchos in the first half as the star forward put constant pressure on CSUN’s defense. Despite having multiple attempts on goal in the first half, Delgado was able to redirect the shots away from goal. UCSB was the more aggressive team in the first half as the Gauchos had 11 shots in comparison to only 3 shots for Cal State Northridge. Even though the ‘Chos were able to have more opportunities, the score was still 0-0 heading into halftime. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half was much of the same as neither team was able to find the back of the net. Cal State Northridge did find their rhythm though as the Matadors were able to put 7 shots on frame but were still unable to score. Both goalkeepers had played really well entering regulation as they combined for a total of 15 saves in regulation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In overtime, sophomore forward Alexis White scored the golden goal to punch the Matadors’ ticket to the Big West Conference final. It was a disappointing loss for Santa Barbara as the squad had multiple opportunities to take the lead during regulation. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although UCSB did not finish the season the way they would have liked, it was still a very successful season — the team was able to finish with 8 wins. One of the main focuses for next season will be for the team to learn how to win the close games as they finished with 5 ties this season. With a year of experience for ‘Chos, there is a lot of confidence amongst the team to grow and turns those ties into wins next season. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, it will be important for a scorer to emerge next season as this was the last collegiate match for star forward Shaelan Murison. Murison finished the year with a team leading with 17 goals and 7 assists. She was undoubtedly the team’s best offensive player and her production will definitely be missed next year. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another player that will be missed is senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese who was incredible in front of goal this season. DeWeese tallied 5 shutouts, 47 saves and a save percentage of 74.6%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future is bright for the team however as there are many freshmen this year who will grow into their roles next year as they look to make an impact. For head coach Paul Stumpf, this season can be built upon for next year where the ‘Chos will look to compete for the Big West title once again. </span></p><div

Barbara women’s soccer team has clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament for the second straight year. A win over Riverside and a tie against Irvine secured Santa Barbara a 4-1-3 conference record and a second-place finish in the regular season conference standings. Now, the Gauchos will head to Fullerton where two more wins will clinch them their first Big West title and NCAA Tournament appearance since 2009. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the semifinal, UCSB will face Cal State Northridge, the only Big West team to have defeated them during the regular season. The Gauchos and the Matadors faced off on Oct. 17 in Northridge and CSUN emerged victorious by a score of 1-0, thanks to a goal scored by Avery DeWitt in the 34th minute of that game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal State Northridge is 11-6-3 on the season and 5-3 in Big West play. The team has five players who have recorded multiple goals on the season, so there are many capable offensive threats. Still, redshirt junior Bethany Fitzsimmons and sophomore Alexis White do a bulk of the scoring with 11combined goals between them. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Matadors are by no means an elite offensive squad, but their solid team defense is capable of strangling teams and gutting out low-scoring wins. CSUN leads the Big West by a large margin with .77 goals allowed per game and they have recorded 10 shutouts, meaning they held a team scoreless in half of their games this season. They play great team defense but they are also anchored by quite possibly the best goalie in the Big West in sophomore Amanda Delgado. Delgado leads the Big West in both save percentage (.808) and goals allowed per game (.87) in just her first season as a full-time starter.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Northridge has held steady since their win over UCSB, going 2-2 in their next four games with losses against UC Davis and Cal State Fullerton. They are not on any sort of hot streak coming into this tournament, but anything can happen in two games, especially with their elite defense; the Matadors are contenders as much as anyone for the Big West crown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is a vastly different team stylistically than CSUN because the Gauchos are a team that will go as far as their offense can take them. More specifically, the Gauchos will go as far as Shaelan Murison, frontrunner for Big West Player of the Year, can take them. That statement is not a hyperbole, because Murison has scored in 12 separate games this season, and UCSB’s record in those games is 7-0-5. Murison leads the conference in goals with 17, a mark that ties her with Jennifer Borcich for the ninth most single-season goals in UCSB history. Murison received her fourth Big West Women’s Soccer Offensive Player of the Week award last week, which is the most for any Gaucho in a single season. She has also recorded a goal or assist in eight of the last nine contests, so it is safe to say she is primed to lead the Gauchos into the Big West tournament. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But UCSB’s future does not entirely rest on Murison’s shoulders because her surrounding cast is full of excellent players such as junior Isabella Viana, who is second on the team in both goals and assists with 4 and 5, respectively. Sophomore Jessica Wright and freshman Dylan Lewis also both have 3 goals apiece this year and have been major contributors in several Gaucho wins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will look to take the first step towards a conference title at 5 p.m. on Thursday in Fullerton.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Segales and redshirt junior Emma Chivers lead the way offensively for Fresno State with two goals each. On the defensive side of the ball, freshman goalkeeper Milena Zink has accumulated 10 saves already on the season with a save percentage of 83.3%.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to have success against Fresno State, it will be important for the ‘Chos to pressure the bulldog midfielders into turning the ball over on their side of the pitch. This will allow Santa Barbara to find more opportunities for transition offensive attacks against a very talented bulldog team.</p>\n<p>Loyola Marymount has struggled mightily this season as their current record is 0-5-2 — the team is on a two-game losing streak as well.</p>\n<p>The Lions lost to No. 13 Washington State in Pullman this past Sunday as the team was unable to score an equalizer.</p>\n<p>Junior midfielder Maki Kono had the only goal of the night for Loyola Marymount and is currently the team’s leading goal scorer.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need to be on their top game against the Lions who are much more talented than their record would indicate.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to find ways to win close games, especially with the team already having three ties thus far.</p>\n<p>That being said, the squad is extremely young and is still trying to find their identity as a team. With more game experience, not only will the chemistry increase but so will the confidence of the team.</p>\n<p>One of the issues that Santa Barbara has faced primarily has been the inability to create opportunities to score.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Shaelan Murison seems to be one of the few players on the roster who can consistently find the back of the net but has now been taken out of the game as opposing teams have double teamed her inside the box.</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to contend for the Big West title this year, another forward must emerge as a consistent goal scorer.<br>\nSophomore forward Jessica Wright seems to be the most likely candidate to step up for the ‘Chos as she has two goals already this season.</p>\n<p>If more players start to score for the Gauchos, this will inevitably free up Murison for her own opportunities to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos have been strong as the team has produced three clean sheets and has given up an average of only one goal per game.</p>\n<p>Much of this can be attributed to the strong play in front of the goal by senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese has looked confident in front of the goal, leading to her save percentage of 80%.</p>\n<p>The senior was just selected as the Big West Defensive Player of the Week, a fitting reward for a week which saw her give up a stingy .9 goals per game to go along with a .846 save percentage on average.</p>\n<p>Moreover, UCSB’s defenders have been formidable as well as opposing offensive players have struggled to get past them.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face Fresno State at home this upcoming Friday at 7 p.m and Loyola Marymount on Sunday at 1 p.m, where the Gauchos will try to get back in the win column at Harder.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Sept. 19</em><em>, 2019 , edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-face-fresno-st-and-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-face-fresno-st-and-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-face-fresno-st-and-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-face-fresno-st-and-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-face-fresno-st-and-lmu/","id":1298,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1297,1296,1295],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Soccer: Cultivating a Legacy","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a fan of UCSB soccer, it would be easy to get used to the success: nine consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament, a National Championship in 2006, 16 All-Americans and 14 current professional playe...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As a fan of UCSB soccer, it would be easy to get used to the success: nine consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament, a National Championship in 2006, 16 All-Americans and 14 current professional players.

The results were immediate. In his first game ever as head coach, he took a 2-0 win over conference rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“He immediately turned things around,” UCSB Assistant Athletics Director Bill Mahoney said. “It was pretty amazing. His teams bring the same intensity to the field that he brings as a coach on an everyday basis. He recruited better players, compiled a really good coaching staff and it was night and day. Everything. You could tell that the players believed in themselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB won 13 games in 1999 — only the third time the team had met that win total in the school’s program’s 33-year history. When he arrived, Vom Steeg set a goal of five years before the team would be competing for a National Championship. Sure enough, by 2004, he was at the helm of the best team he had ever coached, poised to make some noise in the NCAA playoffs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the squad lost the College Cup championship game to Indiana in penalty kicks after dominating possession and shot numbers through regulation.</p>\n<p>“Someone tell me that we lost,” Vom Steeg told the press after the game. “It’s disappointing because I thought we played so well. Not in my wildest dreams did I think we could play that well against that team over the course of 110 minutes, so I thought it was a great performance.”</p>\n<p>Two years later, the team would still be reeling, opening the 2006 season with a 7-6 record midway through the 2006 season. Before Vom Steeg, the team would have rolled over and given up on a season going nowhere. For those Gauchos, though, giving up was not an option.</p>\n<p>“They decided as a group that they didn’t want their careers to end, so the players decided we were going to do something different,” Vom Steeg explained. “We just started playing better, and we eventually caught fire.”</p>\n<p>UCSB rode that heat all the way to 11 wins in 12 games, including six in a row on the way to a second national championship appearance. This time, they took down UCLA 2-1 for the program’s first College Cup victory.</p>\n<p>“It was more than just a win,” defender Andy Iro, who currently plays for the Columbus Crew in the MLS, told the Daily Nexus after the match. “A lot of guys and coaches came through here and this is a culmination of all of this.”</p>\n<p>Since 2007, UCSB has led the nation in attendance every year, including setting an all-time record for an on-campus site when 15,896 Gaucho faithfuls attended a match against the Bruins this season.</p>\n<p>With wins in that match, as well as against Duke, both in front of national television cameras, the 2010 team looked ready to pick up the intensity again, with a chance to play a championship game in front of the largest home crowd in the country. Like the 2006 team, Vom Steeg’s group faced a less than ideal start.</p>\n<p>“Any time you start at 0-2-2, you can self-destruct and doubt yourself,” Vom Steeg said. “But we believed we were destined to do other things.”</p>\n<p>Again, the team recovered, managing to finish the regular season 12-4-3. In the first round of the NCAAs, the team cruised to a first-round win over Denver before falling to UC Berkeley in overtime. In the 24th minute of regulation, a controversial red card called against junior midfielder Luis Silva brought the Gauchos a man down for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p>“It’s been very difficult on the coaching staff, on the players and difficult certainly for a lot of our fans,” Vom Steeg said of the early exit. “When things like this happen, all you can really do is channel that energy into your team, into helping your players. Any time negative things happen, it brings your group closer together.”</p>\n<p>After losing just three seniors, UCSB is already looking ahead to next year.</p>\n<p>“If anything, this is a team that I wouldn’t want to play next year,” Vom Steeg said. “We are unbelievably motivated. I think this is as motivated a group as you’re going to get.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/gaucho-soccer-cultivating-legacy/","id":1297,"author":{"id":93,"name":"Mark Bogard"},"related":[1296,1295,1294],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
