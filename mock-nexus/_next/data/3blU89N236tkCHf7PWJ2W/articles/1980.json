Over the past year, the center has been laying the groundwork for the implementation of pronouns, looking into what departments would be involved with the change and how much work it would take, Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was earlier this year that we got the approval from the university to move forward, and so this summer has really been when the bulk of the work has been happening,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Office of the Registrar, the Division of Student Affairs and Student Information Systems &amp; Technology have been working on the technical end to change the university systems to accommodate pronouns, while Leets has been working on the marketing side of the project; news of the change was first announced in a campus-wide email sent out on Sept. 12 by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the initiative has been implemented at two other UC campuses already, Leets said the biggest hurdle in implementing pronoun functionality has been working around the lack of guidance from the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB – and this is [applicable to] a lot of topics – worries that they will do something and then later the Office of the President will come and say ‘Well, we want you to do it differently,’ and so that will require us to do a lot of extra work to change what we’ve already been doing to respond to what the Office of the President wants,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB intentionally modeled the pronoun options after UCSF’s systems, Leets said, with the idea that if the UC Office of the President (UCOP) decides to start collecting this data, UCOP can recommend that other schools follow UCSB and UCSF’s methods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this implementation is a victory for the RCSGD, Leets said it was only the first step in making the university more inclusive for everyone. The pronoun functionality is only currently available for students, but the ultimate goal is to allow people to choose pronouns through the Campus Directory rather than G.O.L.D., he added, which would allow for staff and faculty members to also indicate their pronouns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, all UCSB students, staff and employees can indicate their preferred name on the directory; Leets said the center is still working out whether or not pronouns will be publicly available or just visible to people affiliated with UCSB, noting that there may be students who would be opposed to having their pronouns publicly available.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Eventually, we would want this data to be as accessible as someone’s name, because names and pronouns are used all the time, by everyone,” he said. “However, as we’re still exploring the impacts on campus for having access to people’s pronouns, we’ll have to decide if everything’s going super well and we can release it in a public way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next big date for pronoun functionality is Sept. 20, when GauchoSpace will update to include pronouns. Leets added that said the center will have a meeting in mid-October to discuss the timeline for transitioning pronoun functionality to the Campus Directory, but noted that it would be at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year at the earliest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD also plans to use the upcoming International Pronouns Day on Oct. 16 as a way to spread the word about the pronoun functionality, such as through tabling in the Arbor. The center also plans to continue to market it during events throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just gonna keep telling people about it –– we wanna get all students, and as many students as possible, to indicate their pronouns,” Leets said. “That’s something that I would really emphasize, is that it’s for all students… It’s not just for trans and nonbinary students. Those students might be the most impacted, hopefully positively by this new functionality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want all students to indicate what their pronouns are to reduce the amount of assuming we do for other people’s pronouns, because we can be wrong when we make those assumptions.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [4:30 p.m.]: GauchoSpace will be updated on Sept. 20, not Sept. 19, as the article originally stated.</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated [5:35 p.m.]: This story has been updated to reflect Dolan’s preferred name. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

It’s a great way to get involved on campus.”</p>\n<p>“We just want to make this a really good, fun program,” Jauch said.</p>\n<p>In its first appearance at the NCA Nationals, Santa Barbara’s cheer team participated in the Intermediate Small Coed I category of the Challenge Cup competition.</p>\n<p>The only California based university within the competitive category, UCSB managed to finish in sixth-place with a final score of 76.48 points in Day Two of the Nationals.</p>\n<p>Able to place two standings above last place, an enticing future seems to be ahead for UCSB’s cheer team as this past weekend was the first step in its progression.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69735\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69735\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/ucsb-cheer-focused-on-growth-participates-in-nca-nationals/","id":1978,"author":{"id":319,"name":"Madeline Ewer"},"related":[1977,1976,1975],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“She doesn’t know that she’s a sea lion and she doesn’t know where she is”: Unhealthy Sea Lion Spotted on I.V.

Once the volunteer arrived to the beach a few hours later, he confirmed to Rogers that the sea lion was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Domoic acid toxicosis starts at the bottom of the food chain, found among the phytoplankton called pseudo-nitzschia. Through biomagnification, the toxicity of this harmful algal bloom — a rapid growth of algae in a small area — becomes more concentrated in animals as it goes from krill to small fish and sardines to the California sea lion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The volunteer] was describing to me how it literally shrinks the size of the sea lion hippocampi … and for the rest of the hour I just listened to him off the edge of my seat with my mouth hanging open,” Rogers explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way he was describing [the sea lion’s] mental state, he equated it to human dementia and was telling me she doesn’t know that she’s a sea lion and she doesn’t know where she is. She doesn’t know that she needs to hunt, she doesn’t know what fish are.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When CIMWI gets a call about domoic acid toxicosis in animals, a volunteer arrives at the scene to assess the animal, but they usually keep the animal in its immediate surroundings instead of relocating to the rehabilitation facility in order prevent further disorientation. The sea lion is left “in a safety perimeter” and volunteers regularly monitor the animal’s condition, according to signs CIMWI posted along I.V. beaches over the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While domoic acid toxicosis seriously impacts the affected sea lion’s health, acute effects dissipate after 72 hours as the toxin works its way through the animal’s body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effects of domoic acid go beyond sea lion health on the Central Coast. Mussels and other shellfish feed on pseudo-nitzschia, which is potentially deadly to humans if they eat affected mussels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we were to say, eat mussels that have been filtering and feeding on pseudo-nitzschia that happen to be toxic … we would pick up those toxins as well,” said Mark Brzezinski, professor of biological oceanography and director of the Marine Science Institute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why when domoic acid levels are high, the shellfish harvesting is put on hold, because those could be poisonous.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While studies clearly indicate a rise in domoic acid due to climate and human-generated issues, there’s not a simple connection between a changing atmosphere and preventing outbreaks of domoic acid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Brzezinski explained, the pseudo-nitzschia phytoplankton does not always produce the toxin, so researchers find it nearly impossible to predict when and where algal blooms will be toxic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because it’s in the water doesn’t mean it’s producing the toxin </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that’s one of the frustrating things. We monitor the amounts of pseudo-nitzschia in the water every week; we take a sample on Monday, and by Tuesday we have the answer. But we also know that the relationship between the number of pseudo-nitzschia out there and toxicity is really poor. The numbers don’t predict toxicity. We can’t infer the toxic bloom just from the number of organisms out there, which is a little frustrating, but we have to be careful interpreting abundance data.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, the same species can be toxic one day and not the other. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not known in a well enough way that, ‘This group’s going to be toxic and that group over there’s not.’ We’re not at that point. It’s one of the areas that people who do this full time are really focused in on, to try and understand that, because it’s a major gap in our knowledge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any future sea lion sightings, CIMWI warns beachgoers to keep their distance even if the sea lion appears approachable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But from what Rogers witnessed on the beach, it will take a lot of diligence for students to keep their space from rare close encounters with marine wildlife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that we live in a very voyeuristic society, particularly with the rise of like heavy documentation of our lives and the things we see. I’d be remiss to say it wasn’t connected to social media,” Rogers said. “But I also do think there’s a kind of benign interest in natural phenomenon, like with a growing disconnect between us and the environment and I think that people are interested in kind of bridging that gap for themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rogers waited hours by the sea lion for CIMWI, telling students to keep their space. For her, the change from her daily routine was a reminder for her to remain active in the fight against climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a moment of reckoning where I was on my second hour of waiting for CIMWI and I was kind of like, ‘Okay, this is taking a long time, I’m dedicating a lot of time to this.’ I was questioning myself, does my emotional response to these kinds of things hinder me or is it a strength? Because I was feeling very drained by the fact that I was watching the sea lion and I didn’t know her fate and I was having this reckoning with myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just hope that students hear this call-to-arms and remain helpful in order to be productive and when they feel this emotional hole to notice and bear witness to what’s happening in the environment. I hope that students follow the path of action rather than the path of denial and paralyzation and don’t let themselves be overwhelmed by what’s happening, but instead let themselves be motivated and kind of be sparked to action and to making change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Tuesday afternoon, the day after Lopez and Simentel’s sighting, the university sent out a notification warning of a mountain lion sighting near the Orfalea Family Children’s Center on West Campus; twenty minutes later, however, the university sent another alert stating the sighting was a “bobcat who has lived in the area for many years without issue.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90339\" style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-90339\" data-attachment-id=\"90339\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/mountain-lion-spooks-students-and-sparks-memes/lbobcat/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?fit=971%2C953&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"971,953\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"lbobcat\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?fit=250%2C245&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?fit=888%2C872&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-90339\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?resize=334%2C328\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?w=971&amp;ssl=1 971w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?resize=250%2C245&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?resize=768%2C754&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lbobcat.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-90339\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The school has sent out a number of warnings over the past few weeks about mountain lion sightings; the first reported sighting was near Campus Point on Sept. 17, the second was on Sept. 18 by Devereux Lagoon and the third was the morning of Sept. 19, near West Campus.
