UCSB Girl Up, an organization that aims to provide a better future and more opportunities for women and girls worldwide, will accept donations during the event going towards aiding girls in Malawi, Liberia, Guatemala, Ethiopia and India.</p>\n<p>Effie Sklavenitis, third-year global studies major and External Vice President of Girl Up UCSB, said the event is an opportunity to support women’s education.</p>\n<p>“Girl Up is shedding light on the need to support girls’ education and inform others about the challenges girls still face today, not only abroad, but in our own country as well,” Sklavenitis said.</p>\n<p>According to Sklavenitis, Girl Up donations go to disadvantaged young girls in other countries who experience inequality and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“According to the Girl Up website, the second most common cause of death for girls between the ages of 15 to 19 is complications from pregnancy and childbirth,” Sklavenitis said. “50 percent of all sexual assaults worldwide are against girls 15 or younger, and one in seven girls in developing countries is married before the age of 15.”</p>\n<p>Emily Farrell, third-year anthropology major and Social Media Chair for Girl Up UCSB, said the organization raised money to provide bikes for girls in Malawi two years ago.</p>\n<p>“In a month they had raised more than $100,000 to provide bikes, bike parts and maintenance training to 550 adolescent girls,” Farrell said.</p>\n<p>Farrell said the organization is hopeful there will be a good turnout for the screening.</p>\n<p>“Two weeks ago, we hosted a screening of ‘Girl Rising,’ which had a good turnout, but we expect ‘He Named Me Malala’ to be even bigger and better,” Farrell said. “People love Malala and this film is a fantastic documentary, an inspiring account of what she has achieved so far at only 18 years old.”</p>\n<p>Diana Torres Luevanos, fourth-year biological anthropology and history of art and architecture double major and President of UCSB Girl Up, said all girls should have the same rights to education.</p>\n<p>“We are being helped to get an education,” Luevanos said. “Why should girls in developing countries not have the same rights? Why are their dreams worth less than ours?”</p>\n<p>Torres Luevanos said the screening is a great opportunity for the students to understand how fortunate they are to be able to contribute to the advancement of young women and girls who don’t enjoy the same privileges.</p>\n<p>“By showing this movie, we want to show that just as Malala is getting her education, every girl, no matter where they are, they deserve the same rights as we do, they deserve their dreams to be supported and those dreams can be chased with a pen, paper and a school,” Luevanos said.</p>\n<p>Shreya Shailendra, third-year psychology major and Outreach Chair of Girl Up UCSB, said it is “every human being’s right” to receive an education.</p>\n<p>“Hence, it is important to recognize the people who, like Malala Yousafzai, fight for these girls’ rights despite having terrifying amounts of opposition,” Shailendra said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/girl-up-to-host-screening-of-he-named-me-malala/","id":2539,"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias"},"related":[2538,2537,2536],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":128,"name":"Siboney Arias","biography":"Not available","articles":[2539,2549,2581,2612,2635,3853,4577,4637],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Student Health Provides Meningitis B Vaccine","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Student-Health-Gaucho-Insurance-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Student-Health-Gaucho-Insurance-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In light of a recent meningitis B outbreak at Santa Clara University, the Student Health Center is providing 3,000 meningococcal vaccinations to UCSB students.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In light of a recent meningitis B outbreak at Santa Clara University, the Student Health Center is providing 3,000 meningococcal vaccinations to UCSB students.</p>\n<p>The vaccinations, Bexsero and Trumenba, have been recently approved for the UCSB Health Clinic, and will be offered to students at the drop-in immunization clinic.

Amputation is a fairly common event in response to meningococcal infections.”</p>\n<p>Shane Yen, second-year pre-biology major and one of many students waiting in line to get a vaccination last Friday at the Health Center, said he was looking forward to receiving the vaccination.</p>\n<p>“I usually don’t look forward to getting shots,” Yen said. “But when you’ve got a deadly infection like meningitis, which could potentially kill you, I’m actually really eager to get this shot. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson provided tips for students to stay safe and prevent catching the disease and encouraged students to get the vaccine as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“The most important way to prevent this infection is to get the vaccine — that’s number one,” Robinson said. “Other than that, avoid people who are sick, try not to share secretions and be aware in overcrowded situations.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson said the disease is contracted in social settings, which makes it especially important for college students to get the vaccine.</p>\n<p>“In times when there are outbreaks, visiting bars, drinking alcohol and smoking are also risk factors for catching it,” Robinson said. “But by far, the most important thing is to get the vaccine.”</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Robinson, the vaccine’s most common side effect is soreness at the injection site. Others can include fever, headaches and rare muscle aches, but these conditions are “a whole lot better than losing your life.”</p>\n<p>“The saddest thing as an infectious disease specialist is to see a young, intelligent, perfectly healthy student die or become maimed from this infection, when I know that it is preventable with a simple shot,” Dr. Robinson said.</p><div

A UCPD officer at the scene said the minor blaze was likely caused by “a careless smoker.”</p>\n<p>Cabe Fletcher, building and resource manager for the Chemistry Building, said “people were using [the steps] as an ashtray.”</p>\n<p>When Shelor was pouring water on the fire, he said a whole pile of “cigarette butts were burning” on the steps.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully, this puts it over the top for no smoking,” said Shelor, who asked that students refrain from smoking on campus.</p>\n<p>No injuries were reported in the minor fire.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70091\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-staff-member-puts-out-minor-blaze/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70091\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-staff-member-puts-out-minor-blaze/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-staff-member-puts-out-minor-blaze/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-staff-member-puts-out-minor-blaze/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-18/ucsb-staff-member-puts-out-minor-blaze/","id":2537,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2536,2535,2534],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
