Womyn’s Commission</p></div>\n<p>According to the conference mission statement, the event recognizes that womxn of color are members of marginalized communities whose shared experiences come to shape their identity in society. The purpose of the conference, then, is to create a means of supporting ethnic minority womxn — to “exist unapologetically.”</p>\n<p>“We work towards empowerment for ourselves in a world that tries to shame or erase our existence,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>Organizers have laid out several questions they hope to discuss throughout the weekend, such as “How do we navigate and come to comprehend our trauma in relation to our very existence?” and “Why is it important to center our movements on love and re-incorporate joy into every aspect of our lives in order to counteract this dominant narrative of struggle?”</p>\n<p>“We hope to generate answers to these questions through a combination of individual reflection and the sharing of collective knowledge,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>Karen Hanna, graduate student in feminist studies and event volunteer, said she and Lola Mondragon, graduate student in Chican@ studies, will be hosting a workshop titled “Sacred Bodies, Safe Spaces: Healing in Community Through Drumming, Meditation, and Coloring.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a place that we can build and say it’s for us, and we don’t have to feel guilty about that,” Hanna said.</p>\n<p>As an Asian American womxn, Hanna said she often feels devalued by stereotypes that define Asian womxn as quiet and submissive. Hanna said the conference offers a place of healing for womxn of color who are often subject to stereotypes.</p>\n<p>Michaela Austin, first-year environmental studies major and feminist studies minor, said WOCC acts as an opportunity for ethnic minority womxn to discuss issues that society does not otherwise address.</p>\n<p>“Living in a racialized patriarchal society, womxn, and especially womxn of color — our needs aren’t met. We’re not talked about in issues,” Austin said. “Having a space where we can talk will build solidarity and space.”</p>\n<p>According to Mondragon, the conference is a “sacred” space for womxn of color to support one another.</p>\n<p>“It’s not only sacred but it’s a safe space where we have a shared experience in multiple ways as we can come together to help lift each other up, lean on each other and see each other,” Mondragon said. “We aren’t usually seen by others in a world where we’re often invisible.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Feb. 25

soldiers on Tuesday as part of a nationwide tour put on by the organization StandWithUs.</p>\n<p>The Israeli Soldiers Tour program enables reserve duty Israeli college students to share their experiences as ordinary Israeli citizens, their views on the Arab-Israeli conflict and their personal stories to reveal the individuals behind the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The tour has travelled throughout the U.S., visiting colleges, high schools, synagogues and churches.</p>\n<p>Danielle Cohen, third-year film and media studies and sociology double major, said the discussion provided a first person account of the experiences of the Israeli soldiers.</p>\n<p>“It’s really cool to get first hand experience from the Israeli soldiers’ perspective, especially because we spend so much time learning about Israeli policies in conflict. It’s really insightful to hear from them,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Eidan Shalom said he was interested to hear from IDF soldiers firsthand about their experiences.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a cool opportunity to speak to the people that are actually there. Primary sources, rather than what we hear on the media,” Shalom said. “Hear from the people that see it — that live it.”</p>\n<p>Both guest speakers chose to share only their first names with the audience, as there had been angry comments posted on social media concerning members of IDF coming to speak.</p>\n<p>Gilad, 27, spent six years in the IDF as a paratrooper and later as part of the Intelligence Corps. He said the media does not effectively portray the experiences of soldiers in Israel.</p>\n<p>“We say in Israel we don’t always have a choice on if we want to fight or not, but we do have a choice on how we fight,” Gilad said. “This is one of those things you won’t hear about in the news because you really don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Edan, 28, was with the ground combat division. He is pursuing a PhD in a program involved in researching heart regeneration to help fight against heart attacks. According to Edan, the purpose of the tour is to inform the public about the plights of Israeli soldiers in order to counter media sources that misrepresent them.</p>\n<p>“[I] could go on and on about my research, but that’s not why I’m here. My heart, and Gilad’s as well, is under a different kind of attack. In saying that I mean we hear and we follow what goes on around the world,” Edan said. “Sources change all kind of acts and makes all of these accusations about us towards Palestinians. And this is very tough for us and very frustrating. And that’s why we’re here, going around and sharing our personal stories and giving people the opportunity to listen to real stories without anyone changing it in the process.”</p>\n<p>Gilad said he became involved in the Israeli army because he felt it was the best thing he could do for himself.</p>\n<p>“I know we come and we talk and parts of the army might sound cool. But it sucks. But you really do it because you understand that this is the most important thing you could be doing with yourself right now and it is for me,” Gilad said. “And you ask what you get from the army? And for me, it’s a sense of proportion.”</p>\n<p>The Israeli Soldier tour is in its first session, traveling around the Southern United States. A second tour will begin in mid-April touring the Northern states.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

others’ experiences. <em>Photo Courtesy of RateMyProfessors.org</em></p></div>\n<p>RateMyProfessors.com allows students to anonymously evaluate professors on a five-point scale for categories like helpfulness, clarity and even their professor’s “hotness.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB students are familiar with the site, and some even rely on it to decide between classes, what do their professors think? The Nexus interviewed some highly rated instructors to see what they think about the website.</p>\n<p>Communication professor Desiree Aldeis, who scores a 4.9, said she feels the website is a helpful tool for students, provided they “take it with a grain of salt” and remember the evaluations are subjective.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a useful tool that students can utilize to make better choices and more informed choices for the classes that they sign up for,” Aldeis said. “And I think students are also aware that these are their peer’s opinions and their peer’s experiences might be different from their own.”</p>\n<p>Aldeis said that the website is also useful to professors so that they can see what aspects of their teaching style are and aren’t working for students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s important that professors get on there and read what their students say about them because there may be some things that you don’t know you’re doing that are not working well for your audience,” Aldeis said. “I feel like it’s a lot of information for us as professors in terms of how we can maybe improve or even the things we can continue to keep doing.”</p>\n<p>German professor Evelyn Reder, who also scores a 4.9, said students should avoid choosing courses based on the subjective reviews of others.</p>\n<p>“There must be some truth to it, but you also don’t know — it’s so individual and so subjective,” Reder said. “To be sure, you have to try them out, you can’t really base it on someone else’s judgment, so it’s probably not the best way of picking a class.”</p>\n<p>Reder also said the website tends to only attract students with very extreme opinions.</p>\n<p>“I kind of feel from what I’ve seen that only students that really love you or really hate you will write a review and everybody in the middle kind of doesn’t really bother,” Reder said. “I try to do my best, I try to really take my students’ voices into account and try to be there for them, but I think in every class you have students that love you and students that don’t like you so much.”</p>\n<p>Emma Levine, a graduate student studying music, is a teaching assistant with a perfect five rating on the site. She said students should be wary of personal evaluations, because students may form strong opinions about professors based on little experience.</p>\n<p>“I did find as an undergrad that it’s useful so students can report on things like here’s how many tests there are, how many quizzes or papers or how the class is run,” Levine said. “As far as kind of personal evaluations, it’s sort of hit or miss — you can get a student who just has one very strange interaction with the professor and then just hates them forever.”</p>\n<p>That said, Levine said a teacher can make or break a class.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a TA for music appreciation class here. I’ve also taught the class, and depending on who’s teaching it, it’s a completely different class,” Levine said. “I think if you have a really great teacher, it almost doesn’t matter what they’re teaching, it’s going to be a good class.”</p>\n<p>While some student’s opinions may not be representative, Aldeis said, evaluations with a number of negative comments are often accurate.</p>\n<p>“It may be the case that one student had a very negative experience so they use that platform to vocalize it or voice their frustrations and things like that,” Aldeis said. “But … when you read multiple comments and they’re all saying the same thing, more or less, or have the same kind of theme to each one of them, then I don’t think that’s a sign of unfairness or inaccuracy. If anything I think that’s something that students should really consider.”</p>\n<p>Eric Engel, a chemistry tutor with Campus Learning Assistance Services (C.L.A.S.), has a 4.9 rating and criticized the website’s “easiness” rating.</p>\n<p>“With teachers being rated on easiness, I think that’s kind of a reflection of students not taking classes seriously or not really knowing that being forced to work is going to help them,” Engel said. “Maybe they’re seeing classes as a hurdle or obstacle to take to get to their degree and not really appreciating the benefit of hard work.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Britteny Young said she may look for a high “easiness” rating when choosing general education or prerequisite classes but would not do the same for classes within her major.</p>\n<p>“I’m a psych major, so math isn’t really my thing, so if I can find a teacher that’s reported to be easy then, yeah,” Young said. “But for my major requirements, I don’t think that’s a positive cause I’m paying for it, so might as well get the best.”</p>\n<p>Young said that overall she feels like RateMyProfessor.com evaluations are generally accurate and are useful for both students and professors.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a great idea,” Young said. “Obviously there’s extreme responses from people — either you loved it or you hated it — but I think overall you get a really good feel for the class. I think it’s good for teachers to look at it — sometimes they can be in their own worlds.”</p>\n<p>Rubí Rodríguez, a fourth-year political science major, said she would never use the website because she wants to form her own opinions.</p>\n<p>“If it works, it works, but I’ve never used it or thought about using it just because I don’t like to have or be stopped from taking a class or professor because the ratings are wrong,” Rodríguez said. “That way, I can choose for myself and not come out with an idea that doesn’t necessarily apply to me.”</p>\n<p>Rodríguez said that choosing a professor based on easiness also sometimes makes sense, because students have to consider how their choices will affect their GPA.</p>\n<p>“I think as a college student, what you want is to succeed,” Rodriguez said. “And I think with easiness you think ‘Ok I can excel. I can raise that GPA and fulfil this credit.’”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67927\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67927\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-professors-rate-ratemyprofessor/","id":2621,"author":{"id":132,"name":"Vicky Munro"},"related":[2620,2619,2618],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Peace Corps Rank Rises","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara’s rank among universities producing Peace Corps Volunteers rose from 18th to eighth place in 2015.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>In 2015, UCSB had the eighth highest number of Peace Corps volunteers among universities, increasing from a ranking of 18th in the previous year</h3>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s rank among universities producing Peace Corps Volunteers rose from 18th to eighth place in 2015.</p>\n<p>Since U.S. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961, over 220,000 Americans have volunteered with the organization in 141 countries. Currently, there are 43 UCSB graduates serving in 27 countries including Paraguay, Mali and Cambodia.</p>\n<p>The top recruiter for large colleges and universities is University of Washington with 72 volunteers abroad. Among medium-sized colleges and universities George Washington University ranked first, and Gonzaga University tops the list for small colleges and universities.</p>\n<p>Tymon Manning, UCSB alumnus and Peace Corps regional recruiter for Los Angeles, said he is glad to see the positive effects of recruitment efforts at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We work with career services to set up information sessions, post positions through the job portal and attend career fairs,” Manning said. “And then I’ll do things like class talks encouraging students to come to our events.”</p>\n<p>Manning said he has seen an increase in “sustained interest” from UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really nice that we are moving ahead even as the number of applications is increasing,” Manning said about UCSB’s eighth place rank. “It makes me proud to think that students are becoming more interested in the world and not just getting jobs in America or California … We are getting more globally minded.”</p>\n<p>Tara Flint, UCSB alumna and Peace Corps returnee, said she was always interested in the Peace Corps because her father volunteered in the 1980s, and she decided to join after hearing a representative speak in an environmental careers course at UCSB.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68601\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68601\" data-attachment-id=\"68601\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/ucsb-peace-corps-rank-rises/peacecorps/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?fit=1440%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"peacecorps\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps.jpg?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68601\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/peacecorps-1024x512.jpg?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"Several UCSB alumni who later became Peace Corps volunteers were encouraged to join the program by Peace Corps representatives who gave presentations on campus.

you just have to make sure that it is the right thing for you to do at that point in your life.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of UCSB Career Services Emily White said Peace Corps is establishing relationships with many different departments and has presence at career fairs, application workshops and career panels.</p>\n<p>“Over the last two years, Career Services has been working with Ty Manning … who really understands UCSB and has been able to increase the numbers in Peace Corps volunteers,” White said. “He is promoting the Peace Corps in all different types of places, all throughout campus and its different communities.”</p>\n<p>This year, the Peace Corps will be “heavily involved” in UCSB’s LGBTQ events, according to White.</p>\n<p>“You can really see the success in building those relationships and getting the word and opportunities of the Peace Corps out there,” White said.</p>\n<p>Darlene Moreno, UCSB alumna and current Peace Corps volunteer in Armenia, said she attended Peace Corps information sessions at UCSB to learn more about the organization and even kept in touch with UCSB’s Peace Corps recruiters up until leaving for her service.</p>\n<p>“Through these sessions, I learned more about the application process and what the Peace Corps was looking for in a volunteer,” Moreno said in an email. “Because of the suggestions I received during these sessions, I became a volunteer at my old high school and at a local library near my home in Los Angeles in order to gain more experience with students before applying to the Peace Corps.”</p>\n<p>Carl Haislett, UCSB alumnus and current Peace Corps volunteer in Lesotho, said Peace Corps’s campus recruitment events taught him about the organization.</p>\n<p>“I contacted our school’s recruiter, Tyman, and met with him a few times to discuss the application process,” Haislett said in an email. “I also attended an event put on by the Santa Barbara Peace Corps Association which was a great way to meet returned volunteers and pick their brains.”</p>\n<p>Haislett said UCSB’s recent ranking does not come as a surprise.</p>\n<p>“I’m super proud,” Haislett said in an email. “Gauchos are high achievers and are doing big things everywhere.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Feb. 25 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
