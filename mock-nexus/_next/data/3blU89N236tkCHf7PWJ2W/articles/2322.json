The new S.M.A.R.T. Recovery meeting and Graduate/Non-Traditional Student 12-step meeting diversify the organization’s approach, allowing for students with different paths and a more cognitive method of addressing addiction.</p>\n<p>GFR also began hosting an Alanon meeting for family members and loved ones affected by people with substance use disorders, who are either working or not working toward recovery.</p>\n<p>Bryan founded GFR in the fall of 2012 after working in the UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program as a marriage and family therapist.</p>\n<p>After researching other campus-based collegiate recovery programs, Bryan found a similar program at Texas Tech University, which provided grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for replication programs on other campuses.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in long-term recovery for 13 years so this is something that I was really interested in,” Bryan said. “So [SAMHSA] paid for me to go out there and see their program and see how we might start it here.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Behavioral Wellness Department agreed to contribute start-up funding for GFR after Bryan met someone within the department who “happened to be in long-term recovery also.”</p>\n<p>According to Bryan, UCSB is the only UC that has an Alcohol and Drug Program. The program has been around for nearly 10 years, which Bryan said shows that the university already recognizes that support is needed. She believes recovery fit naturally into the campus services.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been very lucky here because UCSB administration has always been really supportive of this program,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>“The 18-25 age group is the fastest growing number of people going for treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. So we’re seeing a lot more students coming to college already in recovery or students getting into recovery while in college,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>At the start of the program, there were less than 10 people in attendance, and now at least a few dozen show up for meetings, according to fourth-year physics major and peer-intern Noah Shachar.</p>\n<p>“So nationally it’s a huge trend that we’re seeing, which is why there’s over 100 schools across the country that have some form of collegiate recovery support,” Bryan said. “We’re definitely one of the leaders in the country in development and what we have to offer here in our program.”</p>\n<p>GFR also hosts “sober events” for students to get out of I.V., including two camping trips a year, as well as “unity events,” Shachar said.<br>\nThe camping trips are organized in Spring Quarter around Deltopia and in Fall Quarter around Halloween. Bryan said these trips provide students alternative spaces when Isla Vista “isn’t a recovery-friendly environment.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody is mandated to come to our program; it’s all people that want our support on a voluntary basis,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>Advocacy work helps change campus culture and reduce the stigma that a person in recovery is a “stereotypical addict,” Shachar and Bryan agreed.</p>\n<p>“When we use the term ‘person in recovery’ it sounds like someone that is trying to make some changes and are goal-oriented toward recovery… Someone in recovery is constantly in recovery and constantly improving upon themselves,” Shachar said. “We’re here to show people that you can start doing that at any time, at any age, in any situation — if that’s what you want.”</p>\n<p>GFR just ended its last year in contract with the county Behavioral and Wellness department because of policy changes. It is uncertain where funding will come from next year. However, Bryan said she is not worried because of support from the university and acquired grants.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to trust that things will happen because so far in developmental programs that’s just how things work,” Bryan said. “Right when we think something isn’t going to work, something always comes out of the work, and we go from there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Feb. 15 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Correction: A support group mentioned in this article was referred to as “Alcoholics Anonymous” and has been modified to its correct name, “Alanon meeting.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81107\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/program-for-recovering-addicts-expands-to-meet-diverse-community-needs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81107\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/program-for-recovering-addicts-expands-to-meet-diverse-community-needs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/program-for-recovering-addicts-expands-to-meet-diverse-community-needs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/program-for-recovering-addicts-expands-to-meet-diverse-community-needs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/program-for-recovering-addicts-expands-to-meet-diverse-community-needs/","id":2322,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2321,2320,2319],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio","biography":"Not available","articles":[2295,2312,2322,2324,2328,2330,2357,2358,2388,2393,2394,2395,2397,2399,2408,2718,2720,2772,3572,3612,3654,3768,3803,3822,3826,3923,3924,3929,3959,4360,4444],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

They are the only candidates on this year’s ballot who are running independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both currently work within A.S. Ettleson is currently the chief of staff within the OSA, while Martinez is a letters and science senator within the A.S. Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the issues addressed during Monday’s S.A.G. debate:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>TRANSPARENCY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said she would be as transparent as she can be with case work due to the confidential nature of the information within the office, but will be “as transparent as possible with [her] own work” and what students’ needs are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez was not present to answer the first question as she arrived late.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>ROLE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez described the S.A.G. as someone who is “willing to speak out for communities who have historically been silenced on campus” and is focused on making A.S. more accessible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said the role of S.A.G. is complex and focuses on helping students with issues such as housing policy and violations of student code of conduct, as well as helping students navigate issues with the administration. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>EXPERIENCE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson explained her role as the OSA’s chief of staff, working “with the operations of the office, advocating for students’ needs in the association and throughout the community [and] working with the current Student Advocate General.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said that, as a senator, she has served on the housing committee, created the first international student BCU, the first public and mental health commission and was the only senator to serve on the housing and textbook affordability committee.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>PRESSING ISSUES STUDENTS FACE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Martinez, the biggest issue students face is making higher education more accessible due to the problems under the current Trump administration, specifically for students who come from marginalized and disadvantaged communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said the most pressing problem students have faced this past year is “how many issues are being [dealt with],” including food insecurity, housing problems, increasing tuition and various legal issues. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>PARTISANSHIP</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about partisanship within the UCSB community, Ettleson said this position requires “putting the job first and yourself second” in order to remove personal interests from the matters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez referenced Ettleson’s point, emphasizing that the job is number one and that regardless of political affiliations, the “ability to make a difference in somebody’s life and the ability to change and make or break somebody’s career” comes above all.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>IMPROVING S.A.G.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said she wants to make sure the office is operating at maximum effectiveness with “increased sufficiency.” She explained that she would like office hours to be held in other spaces on campus to increase accessibility and implement programs that would reduce the number of housing and student code of conduct violations, specifically aiming to make OSA a household name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said she would like to expand on the current S.A.G.’s polling project by implementing community organizers who would then specifically work to target first-year students. “[I want to] tailor our resources, our programs and our outreach to make sure that the services the office offers [are beneficial],” she said.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>INVOLVEMENT IN A.S. IF NOT ELECTED</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If not elected, Ettleson said she would “try and be involved in Associated Students in any way that would help me continue some of the work that needs to be done” and help bridge the gap between Associated Students and the rest of the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said she would focus her energy on making sure that the BCUs she created are up and running and would continue to make sure that her work as a senator would “continue regardless of the position that [she holds.]”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 52 A.S. candidates will be up shortly.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Martinez said she was the only senator to serve on the housing and textbook affordability committee, not the textbook affordability community. She created the first public and mental health committee, not the first mental health committee, as previously stated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Finance and Business (F&amp;B) committee voted on Feb. 26 to reallocate an existing fund for a new A.S. Bike Shop building toward a Bike Shop in the University Center (Ucen) instead. In late March, the Office of Budget and Planning provided updated calculations for the UCen fees.</p>\n<p>Students voted to approve a new bike shop building fund back in 2006. The building has never been built and students continue to use the existing Bike Shop building to repair their bicycles.</p>\n<p>F&amp;B Chair Kian Maalizadeh obtained updated calculations of how potential UCen student fees would look.</p>\n<p>With the Bike Shop funding now going toward the UCen renovation, the two student fees for the UCen project would decrease. The fees will be voted upon on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The first $21.42 fee is now $20.40 and will still be in effect from 2018 to 2022. The second $99.61 fee is now $96.06 and students will pay it from 2022 to 2052.</p>\n<p>Both fees will take effect if students vote to pass the UCen project later this month.</p>\n<p>In the 12 years since the fund was created, students have paid the resulting $5.50 quarterly student fee and voted to reaffirm it every two years. The fee has generated over $2 million in revenue in the process, Maalizadeh said.</p>\n<p>“We have this fee that’s being voted on every two years and that’s just sitting there to be used for a new Bike Shop,” Maalizadeh said. “[The UCen project] is the only plan that’s actually been proposed to use those student fees.”</p>\n<p>After the Bike Shop is built in the UCen, the lock-in fee associated with it would expire. The current Bike Shop building, located next to Parking Lot 29 on campus, would be demolished.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Bike Shop is housed in a 40-year-old cargo container that is “not meant for human occupation,” the official F&amp;B reallocation ballot language reads.</p>\n<p>“There are no bathrooms, the floors are rotting and it is a hazard to the students occupying the space,” the language reads.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCen fee rises with inflation rates</strong></p>\n<p>While the UCen ballot petition language referred to two successive student fees, the second fee is not fixed. Instead, the fee will climb each year, roughly alongside inflation rates, according to a fee referendum document obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Before the 30-year fee was adjusted for the Bike Shop reallocation, it stood at $99.61. But with inflation rates, the fee rises each year by a rate that ranges between just under 0.7 percent to about 1.17 percent.</p>\n<p>As a result, the $99.61 fee increases to about $129.46 in 2052, the final year the fee would be in effect. That would push the total revenue generated from student fees to a number much higher than the $193 million the <em>Nexus </em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">reported</a> in early March.</p>\n<p>Now, the $99.61 fee has been offset to $96.06, but inflation will still apply to the reduced fee, and the total amount of money raised from student fees will be much higher than $48 million, which is what officials say is the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>It is unclear at this time how exactly the new projected fees would be affected by inflation.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le did not confirm that the new amounts will rise by the same rates because no one has run the numbers yet, he said.</p>\n<p>“Those figures haven’t been calculated yet for these new numbers,” Le said. “But we do know, with this new $2 million in place, what the initial figures are.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Inflation estimates inconsistent across fees</strong></p>\n<p>Not many other student fees at UCSB appear to be affected by inflation. For instance, the fee for the last UCen expansion, voted through in 1994, hasn’t risen from an initial figure of $20.42.</p>\n<p>The inflated costs are lower than what real inflation rates will look like over the next 34 years, UCSB economics professor Peter Rupert told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“Realistic inflation is going to be more like 2 percent,” said Rupert, who also directs the local Economic Forecast Project. “Right now it’s incredibly low, it’s the lowest it’s ever been.”</p>\n<p>The UCen renovation, dubbed the “NewCen” initiative, was first proposed by Le in January. It would provide expanded office space to student services like Food Bank, Counseling and Psychological Services and Campus Learning Assistance Services. In addition, a renovated UCen would provide a 24/7 study space and a campus pub.</p>\n<p>With the F&amp;B’s reallocation, the finished UCen will also include a new A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>Students can vote to approve the initiative with 50 percent plus one “yes” vote on the spring A.S. elections ballot.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the

id=\"caption-attachment-72474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The memorandum of understanding will guarantee admission for all qualified transfer students from California Community Colleges, increasing the number of students at all nine UC campuses. Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>University of California President Janet Napolitano signed a joint agreement with California Community College Chancellor Eloy Ortiz Oakley to put forth a “comprehensive effort” to guarantee admission for qualified transfer students to all nine UC campuses.</p>\n<p>The memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed on April 11, will increase the number of Californians who pursue higher education, Oakley said in a press release.</p>\n<p>Napolitano said this collaboration with the community college system will allow for a “streamlined” transfer process for qualified students as well as prepare them for transitioning to the UC System.</p>\n<p>According to Napolitano, the UC system hopes to implement these changes and see the “tangible, positive” effects by Fall 2019.</p>\n<p>The agreement would guarantee a place in the UC system for transfer students who complete one of the UC pathways and earn the necessary grade point average (GPA). The UC transfer pathway is a roadmap that outlines courses that community college students should take to establish themselves as competitive candidates for transferring.</p>\n<p>Transfer Admission Guarantees (T.A.G.s) that already exist between students and each university will still be in place, according to the memorandum.</p>\n<p>UCSB already has a “campus-specific guarantee” in place to accommodate community college transfer students, but will “continue to work closely with transfer students to explain their options for enrolling into our guaranteed program,” said UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop.</p>\n<p>The MOU states the UC Academic Senate — in conjunction with the California Community Colleges Senate — agreed to accept students who earn an associate degree at a community college where their degree “meets or exceeds the major requirements in a UC transfer pathway for the same major.”</p>\n<p>Julie Bruno, president of the Academic Senate for CCC, emphasized the importance of students earning their associate’s degree in addition to successfully transferring to a UC.</p>\n<p>The MOU sets forth several partnerships and programs to help community college students —particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds — meet the academic standards necessary for UC admission.</p>\n<p>Partnerships to enhance transfer students’ preparation for enrollment in the UC system include a UC campus summer program for prospective transfers and summer bridge programs for admitted students.</p>\n<p>The agreement highlights the importance of prioritizing transfer students and argues that this is a responsibility shared among all institutions of higher education.</p>\n<p>One of the actions outlined in the MOU calls for increased training for faculty to help them better serve transfer students and understand their specific needs.</p>\n<p>The most recent MOU builds upon previous MOUs, particularly one from 1996 that led to an increase in enrollment of CCC students by over 50 percent. In the last four admission cycles alone, the UC increased its transfer enrollment by 20 percent, reaching an all-time high of 20,000 transfer students in Fall 2017, according to the MOU.</p>\n<p>The agreement says the UC Academic Senate will be responsible for reporting annual data regarding the admissions guarantees to the UC Board of Regents in order to better ensure accountability. This data will also be used to amend the MOU to better meet its objectives.</p>\n<p>The agreement is set to be initiated immediately with the expectation that all relevant efforts will be carried out by the end of the academic year 2021-22, according to the MOU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
