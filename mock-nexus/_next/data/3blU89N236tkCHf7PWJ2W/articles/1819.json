P/NP policies will help students through the tumultuous changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new policy, which was detailed in an email sent to students on Wednesday, was created to mitigate the impact that the coronavirus could have on academic performance and reduce anxiety among students due to the various devastating impacts of the virus, according to Henning Bohn, divisional chair of UCSB’s Academic Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pass/no pass (P/NP) grade does not impact a student’s GPA, and if a department opts in to the grading change by April 17, students can take certain courses as P/NP that previously they could take only for letter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students normally have to decide to have their classes graded P/NP by week seven but can now make the switch anytime up until June 5, the last day of spring quarter instruction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students on academic probation cannot take classes P/NP, and veterans using the GI bill may have to repay money to Veteran’s Affairs if they receive an NP grade, the email continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, Bohn expressed concern that students could overlook possible disadvantages that sometimes come with the P/NP grading option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have very, very mixed feelings. Pass/no pass is something that students should only take when it is to their advantage,” Bohn said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] should probably talk to an academic advisor first to make sure that it’s a wise choice,” he added, citing the possible repercussions students could face when applying to graduate schools.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law schools will recalculate NP grades to an “F” letter grade, according to the email, and many graduate schools could hold unfavorable views on P/NP marks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate schools have a variety of opinions and standards regarding P/NP grades, according to Claudio Campagnari, chair of UCSB’s Department of Physics.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that anybody looking at graduate applications would understand that spring 2020 is a weird time, but who knows?” Campagnari said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that if it were up to him, he would have preferred a mandatory P/NP system for every class, which many schools, like </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/03/20/uc-berkeley-spring-2020-undergraduate-courses-default-to-pass-no-pass-grading/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley</span></a><span

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Stanford</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have adopted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campagnari is optimistic that the new P/NP policies will help students through the tumultuous changes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic but acknowledges that the quarter will likely continue to see more obstacles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really going to be a weird quarter,” Campagnari said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alli Adam, internal vice president of Associated Students, said she hopes that the new P/NP policy will work to alleviate some of the academic burden placed on students, especially those with tenuous access to the internet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have been put in unfair situations and I would hate to see it negatively affect anybody’s GPA because they don’t have the proper resources now that remote classes are happening,” Adam said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

As of March 25, 18 tests have come back negative and 20 tests are pending results, which can take up to a week to get back. All 38 tests were conducted through </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-labcorp-quest-diagnostics-are-growing-testing-capacity.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quest Diagnostics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a private testing laboratory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-08/ucsb-student-health-executive-director-explains-coronavirus-protocol-and-ongoing-measures/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">months</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Student Health has adhered to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the coronavirus and worked with numerous campus entities to devise transmission prevention measures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But recently, Javanbakht said Student Health has also begun designating a prescription pickup area, conducting virtual appointments and cordoning off a section of Student Health so “students who have any kind of respiratory symptom are in a separate part of the building” and to minimize contact between students and workers at Student Health, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any student who visits Student Health during this time will have their temperature taken and will be asked if they are experiencing any symptoms associated with the coronavirus, such as fever, shortness of breath or cough, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our main goal is to do what we can to help our students so that if they end up needing to go to an outside urgent care or emergency room — if COVID spreads as we expect it to — urgent cares and emergency rooms can be really overrun and their demands can be really high,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said that although the off-campus area is out of Student Health’s purview, the university “acknowledges that they are closely tied” with Isla Vista, where thousands of UCSB students packed their bags to ride out the pandemic at home. As a result, the university is closely monitoring how safe it is for students to not only return to campus, but also to Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from Isla Vista if they can; in an email sent out to the student body on March 23, the university urged students to stay at home if they traveled for spring break, noting that Isla Vista has a population of more than 20,000 in less than two square miles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said it is “highly unlikely” that things will return to normal by the end of spring quarter, but “depending on how well we implement our interventions now, as far as social distancing, that could put us in a good position [to return in the] summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the situation doesn’t improve by summer, he said, “we could be looking at fall” for in-person classes to resume.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amidst cancellations and closures, from UCSB’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-26/breaking-ucsb-postpones-commencement-will-host-virtual-ceremony-in-june/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postponed commencement ceremony</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announced Thursday to the order for all </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-25/as-santa-barbara-county-tightens-grip-on-coronavirus-prevention-i-v-businesses-hollow-out/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-essential businesses to close</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many young adults </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/deniers-and-disbelievers-if-i-get-corona-i-get-corona.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have ignored calls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for social distancing in favor of going out and spending time with friends. But students can risk infecting themselves and others when they do so, Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the virus transmits through “secretions” that come from coughing, talking or exhaling, the closer people are to one another, the higher the risk their interactions carry, he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re talking about interacting in a way that would be less risky, interacting outside is always better than any kind of indoor space,” he said. “And keeping six feet regardless of where you are, even outdoors, is much better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In transmitting the virus, Javanbakht said each person acts like an “ember.” People who have the virus can spread it to those who do not — by seeing friends, going out and entering other people’s personal spaces — and create a wildfire of contagion, but by staying at home, “the fire’s not going to spread anywhere because it’s contained within [a] house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication among housemates also matters, Javanbahkt said. For people who plan to stay in I.V. and are living with multiple housemates, he stressed the importance of keeping outside interactions to a minimum — all it takes is one housemate to spread the virus to everyone in the house.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody has three roommates and they’ve lived together all year and they plan to stay together for the rest of spring quarter, that’s great,” he said. “As long as they keep it to those three people and they don’t have people coming over or going over to someone else’s house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all in-person classes have been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">canceled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Javanbakht said campus entities from all corners of the university frequently meet to discuss protocols, contingency plans and emergency operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entities include the UCSB COVID-19 Task Force, made up of the chancellor, vice chancellor, faculty and financial department members, as well as the COVID-19 operations team, which includes the vice chancellor and representatives from Student Health and Housing and Dining Services, he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was during these twice-a-day meetings, which he said have been taking place for several weeks, that campus entities such as the University Library and Recreation Center made the decision to close indefinitely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said the university plans to update the student body about which services they can access during a digital spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the updates will detail “what’s going to be done remotely, what kinds of services are available in person, what’s operating and what’s not operating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are plenty of [messages] that will be coming out as the situation evolves,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
