Much of the night, however, was filled with silence as they mourned their friend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students wrote on a large sheet of paper placed on a table next to a picture of Wang, sharing their favorite memories and expressing how much they missed her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side of the table were flowers and cookies. Wang’s mother wanted cookies there to symbolize how much her daughter loved to bake, Pahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that Wang was so good at baking that her mother eventually stopped ordering from caterers and just let her daughter bake for her events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students who did speak about Wang shared what a positive person she was. For one student, Wang’s enthusiasm was the most contagious thing he said he had ever experienced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another of Wang’s friends, who is a photographer, remembered that she used to ask why he always wanted to take pictures of her when they were at an event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wherever she was, “she made it that much more fun,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said it was hard to talk about Wang but said she was a “great person who I made a lot of memories with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two would spend countless hours talking about anything and everything after general meetings at the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity, Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most amazing thing about Annie is that she was very well spoken and very articulate about what she said,” Pahl said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pahl said one night he went to drop off Wang, but the two found themselves talking through the night instead. While the two were chatting, Pahl accidentally left the emergency lights on his car on. By the time he went to his car, the battery was dead. While he waited for help, Wang was there to keep him company, talking with him for nearly another hour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other friends shared stories of Wang always putting others before herself and being there for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Roy, a fourth-year student at UCSB, also recalled one of her favorite memories of Wang. The two met because Wang would study at San Rafael Residence Hall, where Roy lived, even though Wang was a resident of Manzanita Village. Because of this, Wang would routinely lock herself out late at night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roy said she would usually be up late as well and would always let Wang back in the hall. Roy once asked Wang why she would always go out late at night, despite knowing she had no way back in the dorm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best time to see a shooting star is to go outside at midnight and look straight up at the sky,” Wang responded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night, Roy took Wang’s advice. Though it took a few days, she finally saw her first shooting star.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, Annie was a light,” Roy said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1458.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/jorge-mercado/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Jorge Mercado</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Jorge Mercado is the current Editor in Chief and was a Sports Editor before that since freshman year.

</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lead co-author of the Senate Bill 350 Clean Energy &amp; Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, Williams commended California for revamping its energy sector even as the country has stagnated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[California is] massively decarbonizing our energy sector. We’re getting better at using solar and other alternatives. However, the urgency of the situation is real, because even as California and some other states have moved forward, the country has not,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motta emphasized Carbajal’s enthusiasm for the GND.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was impressed by the aggressive agenda. He called Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and told her that he would like to be an original co-sponsor of the measure,” Motta said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the opening statements, the floor was opened for questions. The panel of four speakers included first-year environmental studies major Elena Salinas O’Toole, fourth-year sociology major Daniel Berchenko, Santa Barbara co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Per Kristian and campaign manager for Jill Stein during the 2012 presidential election and UCSB sociologist Ben Manski. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They addressed questions regarding how common citizens could become involved in the movement, the subject of reparations, the specific policies of the GND and its intersectional nature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski elaborated on how the different approaches to the GND come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s the liberal version which is technocratic, and focuses on a technological shift, there’s the progressive version which in my mind is the one that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done such a great job of articulating, which deals with the need to transition economically, and focuses on specific industries, and then there’s the green party one, which is systemic reform,” Manski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski emphasized the necessity of voting rights and election reform in order to democratize the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristian then highlighted the GND’s approach to mobilizing disenfranchised workers in middle America, similar to the original New Deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you think of a better way to get working people on board than putting people to work doing the work that we need to do to … rebuild our environment?” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berchenko spoke on the technological feasibility of the GND and how solutions already exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The technological fixes have existed for decades. We know that we have the solar capacity, the wind capacity, the hydroelectric capacity to transition from carbon. We know that we have the alternative technologies that we’re going to need to do this. The only thing that we seem to be lacking is the political will,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of particular significance to Salinas O’Toole is the stance that the GND takes with regard to wilderness and open spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I grew up in DC and there we have Rock Creek Park which is polluted and disgusting and for most people that’s the only nature that they’ve ever been exposed to. It’s gotten to the point where, in our society, it’s a privilege to have access to wilderness and I think that’s intrinsically wrong,” Salinas O’Toole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that is at the core of not understanding what’s at stake and preventing the people’s movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel went on to describe how one could become involved in activism and grassroots movements to avoid succumbing to despair and apathy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of that is find a group. Don’t sit at home scrolling through Facebook reading about walruses throwing themselves off of cliffs … it’s a never-ending stream of negativity and you’re just gonna spiral down a hole,” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salinas O’Toole emphasized the necessity of having organizations that listen to youth and give them a voice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was something that I was battling with a lot. I’d go to protests and I felt like I was super involved, but then there’d be this huge lack of response. Having platforms for young people to take hold of this issue that is affecting our generation more than any other generation is critical I think,” Salinas O’Toole said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the conclusion of the town hall, members in the audience were asked what they hoped would come out of the GND; people listed water use regulations, job guarantees, environmentally friendly investment opportunities and improvements in air quality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Berchenko said the two sides in the debate are not conflicts between urban and rural or liberals and conservatives, but rather the common person and corporate interests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Santa Barbara county there are five major oil projects going on right now. They are rebuilding the Plains All American Pipeline which spilled in 2015, on the same route, right next to it,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the people that are actually working that are being affected and that are going to be harmed by environmental issues, versus the small number of corporations and executives that are polluting the world. We can trace 70% of all emissions, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, to 108 companies, 100 of which are still in operation. It’s always been the same people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Berchenko is hopeful about Sunrise Movement SB and the chance for change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of what’s exciting about Sunrise and what’s exciting about the opportunity that’s presented to us now is that a large number of very young people are getting involved in this for what’s potentially the first time. They were really galvanized by the 2016 election and by the political climate that we’re starting to see now,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited about the history that it invokes and what it could be.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Yet, despite Auriemma’s incredible reign at the helm of UConn women’s basketball, he has yet to take the throne as the best ever coach in women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>And he never will because of a woman’s legacy who changed the course of women’s basketball forever and even more broadly, changed the way people think about women. That woman, of course, is Pat Summitt.</p>\n<p>Before Summitt, women weren’t considered competitors, nevertheless athletes. Today, people take women’s sports seriously, which wasn’t the case before her. Women’s equality in sports has a long way to go, but even if you don’t watch the Final Four, you see women’s basketball as a sport.</p>\n<p>She coached before and after Title IX, making $8,900 a year when she started at a school that wasn’t on the map in the basketball world. Summitt drove the bus and did the team laundry. The NCAA didn’t even recognize women’s basketball as an officially-sanctioned sport when Summitt took the head coaching job.</p>\n<p>As a young coach, Summitt rooted her team in defense. Today, defense is one of the biggest focuses in the women’s game. To say Summitt didn’t play a part of that would be ignorant.</p>\n<p>From a popularity standpoint, Summitt put people in the stands to watch females play. In fact, more people headed to the Lady Vols’ games than a game for the men’s team. Her team earned more exposure than the men too. If modern women’s sports had to say thank you to someone, Pat Summitt would be one of the people at the top of that list.</p>\n<p>Women in all sports owe something to Summitt. Without her, there’s no path for Auriemma.</p>\n<p>When Summitt stepped down in 2012, announcing early onset dementia as the cause, women’s basketball lost what Wooden called “the best coach in NCAA basketball history.”</p>\n<p>Honestly, any writer could write a book simply on her accomplishments alone. In her 38 years as head coach of the Lady Vols, Summitt compiled 1,098 wins, the most in NCAA history in any sport male or female. Of the 161 athletes she coached, 94 are current coaches and 12 went on to become Olympians. And if that’s not enough for you, with her eight NCAA championships, she was named the Naismith Coach of the Century.</p>\n<p>As a result, Summitt is argued by many to be the greatest college basketball coach of all time, and one of the best in any sport.</p>\n<p>In a world where women were seen as inferior, she coached her athletes like men. There was no daintiness in practice, running them out of the gym. Those blue eyes could be daggers, but she always got the best out her athletes.</p>\n<p>She created fantastic players, but worked even harder to make them good people, earning a 100 percent graduation rate. Summitt is a class act and it’s earned her respect nationwide. Ever since the diagnosis announcement, “We Back Pat” shirts have been seen on college campus all over the U.S.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that no matter what happens in the future, the women’s sports will owe great appreciation to Summitt. There’s a statue outside Tennessee’s gym of her and the court is named after her, all for a reason.</p>\n<p>No one person has done more for one sport than Summitt and that’s something championships don’t show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of npr.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54801\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54801\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/","id":2051,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2050,2049,2048],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"In Photos | Queer & Trans People of Color Conference 2019","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The conference was organized by a group of six students from UCSB's Queer Commission.

We would have another queer person of color being able to graduate college, when statistically speaking, it is already hard to get in here, and even harder to [graduate],” said Ricardo Uribe, a former Letters and Science senator with the 69th Senate.</p>\n<p>Photos of the event captured by <em>Nexus</em> photographers can be viewed below:</p>\n<p></p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-88624-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88615\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-10.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88614\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-9.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88620\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-2.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88622\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-4.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1203\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88621\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-3.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88617\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-12.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg?fit=1333%2C2000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88616\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-11.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88613\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-8.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88612\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-7.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/05\\/QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"88611\",\"title\":\"QTPOC_Aly-Witmer_ONLINE-6.jpg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Aly Witmer \\/ Daily Nexus\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
