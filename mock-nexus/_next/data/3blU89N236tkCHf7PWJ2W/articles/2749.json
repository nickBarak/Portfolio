Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Training Director Juan Riker led a discussion in which students shared feelings on the upcoming May 23 anniversary and the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident. Students signed chalkboards as a symbol of solidarity.</p>\n<p>San Rafael Hall Multicultural Awareness Chair and second-year sociology major Curnishia Woodbury said freshman students are often alienated from the rest of the UCSB community because they did not experience the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“There is this empathy gap between us and the freshmen who are new here,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>According to Woodbury, open discussions are important because they expose how past events continue to affect people’s lives.</p>\n<p>“Problems are still here,” Woodbury said. “Spring Quarter last year, it was like everybody said ‘how are you?’ but Fall Quarter rolls around and everybody is back to like ‘Hey, I.V., let’s go party.’ They are still perpetuating the same problems that existed before.”</p>\n<p>Woodbury said the group also addressed why society tends to shame men who express their feelings, discussing what it means to be masculine and how society is “perpetuating” a male-dominated society.</p>\n<p>“I hoped that people would keep the dialogue going, keep talking about what masculinity means — what does femininity mean?” Woodbury said. “What are we doing here in this I.V. community? Why do we still perpetuate these same norms when we could change it after what happened?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings. – C.A.P.S. Training Director Juan Riker</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Riker, attendees discussed how women share emotions more frequently and are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.</p>\n<p>“Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Riker said C.A.P.S. encourages students to seek out counseling services during the week of May 23.</p>\n<p>“It is important to stress support and not being alone,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>Riker said his repressed emotions from the events of May 23 last year may have been triggered by the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, that shook all of us — just wrapping our minds around that happening again,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Second-year black studies and sociology double major Chika Anyiw said the chalkboards students signed will be displayed at San Rafael and Manzanita Residence Halls.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the chalkboards is to distribute them, have one be in San Rafael somewhere and the other one be in Manzanita by the central front desk it and if not give it to OSL [Office of Student Life] and then OSL would choose to place it somewhere on campus,” Anyiw said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/","id":2749,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2748,2747,2746],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman","biography":"Not available","articles":[2407,2490,2504,2533,2541,2543,2544,2551,2557,2580,2616,2618,2688,2702,2703,2728,2737,2749,2778,2780,2792,2802,2803,2825,2846,2855,2860,2881,2885,2899,2900,2904,2908,2913,2920,2934,2943,2945,2946,2962,2970,2977,3443,3609,3617,3856,4590,4606,4626,4629,4656,4722,4741,4786,4801,4813],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"A.S.

Senate met Wednesday night in the UCen’s Flying “A” Room for their weekly senate meeting.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate discussed budget reallocations, A.S. Commission on Student Well-Being (COSWB) funding, Monday’s domestic disturbance and the search for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>A.S. Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said due to lack of time left this quarter, he would like to override the legal code and pass a bill that would allow the transfer of $10,000 earmarked for “Professional Development” from the A.S. budget to senate unallocated funds.</p>\n<p>“The process is usually [as follows:] I would have to present the idea two weeks out from the time it needs to be done, and that would have to be ratified by Business and Finance by 50 percent plus one,” Theus said. “Because it’s Week Seven that’s not really going to work so I will need you all to essentially override the legal code and approve that.”</p>\n<p>Theus said Professional Development money went untouched by A.S. this year because it was not needed and could be put to better use by the senate to fund events and groups.</p>\n<p>“I think if there was a need for it, it would have been used, but I don’t think there is a need for it in Associated Students,” Theus said. “I know groups that it could help out a lot internally at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate passed the bill authorizing the transfer of the funds that Senate allocated.</p>\n<p>A.S. President said she was pleased with the student government’s prompt communication with the student body following the May 11 Sabado Tarde incident in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We had a remarkably fast and thorough response because your executive officers were actually meeting at the time of the incident, so we were able to pull together a very quick response,” Guthy said. “I’m very proud of how we handled it. I actually got a lot of administrators and community members thanking students for their involvement, not just executive officers.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said the search committee for a new Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is currently deliberating over two final candidates.</p>\n<p>“We have two finalist candidates for the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs position,” Guthy said. “As you all know, this is a very important position because, obviously, they interact the most with students and deal with student life and a lot of the issues that are pertinent to us.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs candidate Monroe Gordon will meet with student representatives on Thursday.</p>\n<p>“One of the candidates will be on campus tomorrow and he will be having a conversation with students starting at 2:30 in the Mosher Alumni House,” Guthy said. “I think a select group of students were invited to that, but, to my knowledge, it’s not a closed meeting.”</p>\n<p>According to Theus, students are not well enough informed about the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs search committee.</p>\n<p>“Students were not consulted ahead of time in designing the interaction that the candidate will have with students,” Theus said. “The current student meeting is private and invite-only.”</p>\n<p>Theus said students should have the opportunity to interact with candidates because the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs is meant to represent students.</p>\n<p>“There should be an open space where students can meet this person or persons,” Theus said. “This is a very important position for students and we’re sidelined. At least the students on the search committee should be able to observe the candidate while they meet with deans and admin to see how they are as an ally behind closed doors.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Mental Health Coordinator Alex Hill said he is concerned regarding inappropriate spending by COSWB beginning in 2013.</p>\n<p>“Essentially there is a history of inappropriate spending with student fees,” Hill said. “I think there’s some serious misuse of funds. They may not be intentional, but it’s occurring, and you can see it started in 2013.”</p>\n<p>Hill said, despite a $2,500 allocation to advertising, the money is not being used efficiently and COSWB has not been responsive to his inquires about inefficient funding. According to a document Hill shared with the senate, COSWB paid $6,000 for T-shirts and $295 for a tablecloth in the past year.</p>\n<p>“They’re essentially spending vast amounts of money on advertising without any actual function,” Hill said. “They are not providing the services they should be in comparison to the funds they have.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate then moved on to debate the legitimacy of the Bill to Outline a Procedure for the Review of the Executive Branch Expenditures, and whether the bill overstepped certain powers.</p>\n<p>Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said she supports the bill because it requires the executive branch to follow the same rules as other A.S. organizations.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t overstep [of authority] because we’re not actually approving or disapproving … we’re just having [expenditures] reviewed,” Mancini said. “They would have to submit their minutes to us and their expenditures before they spend the money, like any other A.S. agency.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh said the bill is problematic because excessive control of the executive office would result in inefficient financial delegations.</p>\n<p>“From what I understand, I still see it as an overstep. They would have to wait for a whole week for us to approve their spending,” Moreh said. “As we know, things move really fast within the association. If the executive officer needs to move those funds in the time frame of that week and he can’t do it within decent time, that causes problems.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate ultimately passed the Bill to Outline a Procedure for the Review of the Executive Branch Expenditures by a 17-2-0 vote.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang was not present in his office, so various administrators involved in sexual assault policy heard the demands of the students coordinating the sit-in.</p>\n<p>Vasquez said the perpetrator in her sexual assault case was found guilty by the Santa Barbara County Court of Law, but will still be allowed to walk at his graduation commencement on May 13.</p>\n<p>“He got found guilty by the court of law before we started the school year, and the school knew that, and they still offered him university housing across the street from me,” Vasquez said. “Nine months after the school had known, they only gave him a one-quarter sanction, which was this quarter, and they are still allowing him to graduate next year.”</p>\n<p>Chican@ studies Professor Denise Segura said she is disappointed in how the institution for which she works does not provide services that protect students.</p>\n<p>“One of these students who is in my class came to me and I did what I am supposed to do: I referred her to the right people and these right people did not protect her the way I think she should have been protected,” Segura said. “I am ashamed, ashamed to be a tenured faculty of this institution that allows this to happen and I deeply apologize to these women.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista United Methodist Church Reverend Frank Schaefer said by attempting to silence sexual violence cases and criticism of the administration’s policies, the university will only make the situation worse for all parties involved.</p>\n<p>“We are calling on the administration, on school officials, on faculty members, to please take this very seriously,” Schaefer said. “Sweeping things under the rug is never going to be good for the future and if you wanted to address this issue and correct it and restore justice and security for students and any member of this community, you need to face this issue head on.”</p>\n<p>The students demanded mandatory educational workshops on consent and relationships, increased diversity in the Judicial Affairs staff, increased funding to train support staff for sexual assault survivors, free mental health services for survivors, better handling of sexual assault cases, monetary compensation for survivors in past cases that have been mishandled, immediate suspension for more than two quarters and bans on housing, employment and other privileges for convicted perpetrators, among other demands.<br>\nVasquez said she wanted UCSB to instate a minimum penalty for students found guilty of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“There is not a minimum consequence for those convicted of sexual assault, it could be a one-quarter suspension,” Vasquez said. “One or two quarters have been the most a student has gotten.”</p>\n<p>According to Vasquez, UCSB currently has harsher penalties for plagiarism than for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“There is a minimum penalty for plagiarism, but there is no minimum penalty for sexual assault,” Vasquez said. “What’s that say about how they value women or people in general, what do you value about our bodies, what do you value about us, our tuition?”</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major and Gaucho Consent Coordinator Alexa Weyrick said the sit-in is a community effort to change sexual misconduct policies at the university.</p>\n<p>“For example, if a perpetrator is found guilty, they are not immediately suspended,” Weyrick said. “They’re allowed to finish off their quarter, which is disgusting.”<br>\nMelgoza said she wants administration to follow through on the no-contact order brought against her perpetrator.</p>\n<p>“He has been spotted on campus again, and I sent an email about that as well,” Melgoza said. “I want that immediately fixed. I cannot believe that I won, quote unquote, my case and yet he has been spotted on campus various times.”</p>\n<p>Acting Associate Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services and Campus Compliance Officer Pam Lombardo said the UC system has already taken steps to improve how sexual assault cases are handled by forming a Subcommittee on Sexual Violence.</p>\n<p>“I know it doesn’t move fast enough for you, but we are looking at minimum sanctions for different kinds of events, assaults, and I think the area has come to our attention and we are moving as quick as we can, which is sometimes very slow in the scheme of things,” Lombardo said.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean for Student Life Debbie Fleming said administrators have already discussed implementing some of the policies the sit-in demands, such as mandatory preventative education.</p>\n<p>“Several of the things on the list we already have in place so it would be an opportunity for us to talk with students about it, helping them understand what we already have in place,” Fleming said. “We were already just having a conversation in there about some of our mandatory education and we would like to get student input into getting it more effective.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said the process to sanction sexual assault offenders needs to be faster in order to allow survivors to heal and focus on their lives as students.</p>\n<p>“How am I going to focus on my studies and my education if I keep seeing my perpetrator every single day?” Melgoza said. “My perpetrator was supposed to be suspended this spring, yet he is here.”</p>\n<p>Vasquez said she and three other sexual assault survivors demand funding for transportation and board to travel to the next Board of Regents meeting on May 20 and speak to UC President Janet Napolitano and Governor Jerry Brown in public forum.</p>\n<p>“They’re meeting in a couple weeks, so we want traveling funds for that and also to have a spot to speak because Governor Jerry Brown and Janet Napolitano do show up but they walk out on comments,” Vasquez said.</p>\n<p>According to Vasquez, students participating in the sit-in demand a meeting with Yang and financial compensation for the hardships they have experienced at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We won’t leave until we have a written notice that we will meet with him at a date and time,” Vasquez said. “I would also like a written notice of my tuition reimbursement before I leave.”</p>\n<p>Vasquez said the group demands further sanctions on the academic privileges of students convicted of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I also want the school to develop an education intervention program for those who are found guilty of sexual assault, and they are not allowed to receive their degree until that process is done” Vasquez said. “Being a Gaucho is an honor, and that should not be given to offenders of sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>Vasquez also said administrators should go through mandatory “sensitivity training” to be better prepared to aid students who report sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“It’s very unfair these responses coming especially from women,” Vasquez said. “Telling us that it was ‘bad sex,’ and that we ‘need to get over it,’ and that ‘how should they have known that’s not what we wanted?’”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said the administrative efforts to address sexual violence need to work to include students.</p>\n<p>“Me and Alejandra only sit on the Sexual Violence Subcommittee because we heard about it through Ali Guthy since we’re execs in Take Back the Night,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>“Students aren’t able to lend a voice; it’s a bunch of administrators sitting in a room.”</p>\n<p>Fleming said she hopes a small group of representatives from the sit-in will have an opportunity to speak with Yang about the list of demands, but that he was “on the road” and difficult to reach.</p>\n<p>“At this point they would very much like to meet with the Chancellor face to face,” Fleming said. “I’m hoping that can be scheduled. We’re having a little bit of a problem reaching him.”</p>\n<p>Segura said she hopes Yang listens to the sit-in’s demands and takes initiative on speeding the process to implement better policy.</p>\n<p>“The Chancellor has a chance to be a leader rather than just react,” Segura said. “We already know what needs to be done. We already know what’s right. We already know these things. It seems to me the chancellor has the opportunity to help them address the Regents.”</p>\n<p>Wright said the university “systemically” turns its back on sexual assault cases, leaving survivors to seek justice through their own activism.</p>\n<p>“Despite all the trauma, all the suffering that they had to endure, they are the ones that have to stand up here to be judged, to be interrogated, to be questioned,” Wright said. “It is time for this to end.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and Black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said Yang should hear the sit-in’s demands.</p>\n<p>“I think the chancellor should listen to our demands because the tactics are only going to escalate,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President and fourth-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy said she was glad to represent A.S. at the sit-in.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t about me or the association or anything like that,” Guthy said. “If I can get the weight of the association behind this, that is obviously really great.”</p>\n<p>After sitting in Yang’s office for 10 hours, students were able to meet with the Chancellor to discuss demands. Updates to follow.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally

and question and answer session in the MultiCultural Center on Thursday as part of the week-long “We’re fUCked” campaign to protest the proposed UC system tuition hikes.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, UC President Janet Napolitano announced that Governor Jerry Brown and the UC agreed on a revised state budget proposal titled “May Revise,” which will freeze UC tuition for the next two years. Graduate and undergraduate students, Office of Financial Aid representatives, professors, KCSB staff members and Associated Students (A.S.) attended the We’re fUCked discussion, addressing issues regarding tuition hikes and how the May Revise will affect students.</p>\n<p>Though tuition is now frozen for in-state students over the next two years, tuition for out-of-state residents will increase by eight percent per year, according to UCSB Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael Miller.</p>\n<p>“Every student pays the mandatory UC tuition, which is $12,192,” Miller said. “Non-residents supplemental tuition is an additional $24,000 on top of that. Eight percent is definitely not good news for out-of-state students, and we can’t give out-of-state students any more financial aid than we do our California students.”</p>\n<p>According Miller, UCSB has the highest campus-based fees of all the UC campuses with a total cost of $25,836 for a student living on campus, $12,192 of which is for tuition.</p>\n<p>“Our campus-based fees are $1,673 — that is certainly concerning,” Miller said. “One of the other fees that’s really concerning is the Gaucho Health Insurance, which is over $2,700. Just a few years ago, it was $1,375, so that’s been a massive, massive increase.”</p>\n<p>Miller said while about 70 percent of UCSB students receive some form of financial aid, UCSB should allocate more money for scholarships.</p>\n<p>“One area we really need a lot of work on is scholarships,” Miller said. “We only administer about $13.2 million worth of scholarships and, of that, $4.1 come from outside agencies.”</p>\n<p>Gevirtz School graduate student of education and co-host of KCSB’s “Radio Occupy” Kathy Swift said the 2008 market crash created a “tuition crisis” of trillions of dollars in student debt, the highest of any single consumer debt within the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Basically, we have a situation in which we have austerity across the United States, and it’s finally starting to trickle down to the university system,” Swift said. “Student debt and student loans have become the most pressing area of consumer debt in the United States. It surpassed every other area of consumer debt.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the debt students are accumulating while obtaining higher education is negatively affecting their daily lifestyles, which goes against the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“Students are so desperate that we have to provide food banks for them, and some students are living out of their cars and in less-than-good housing situations,” Swift said. “This is madness.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the tuition crisis the millennial generation is facing stifles upward mobility because many cannot afford to pursue a higher education.</p>\n<p>“The mission statement of California says we should all be guaranteed higher education,” Swift said. “That’s not really the case anymore. That social contract is gone now.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63457\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63457\" data-attachment-id=\"63457\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/mcc-may-14th-2015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431618847\",\"copyright\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63457\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Chair and professor of black studies Jeffrey Stewart said the education policy has been changed to outsourcing universities while increasing funding for prisons.</p>\n<p>“The idea of neoliberalism has taken over to where everyone is now looked at as a private corporation,” Stewart said. “The larger dynamic is taxpayers in the state of California no longer think your education is worth their tax dollars. They feel more comfortable paying for prisons to lock up people.”</p>\n<p>Stewart also said the decision to stagnate tuition for two years is only a temporary solution to satisfy student concerns, and problems will still be present at the end of the freeze.</p>\n<p>“Freezing the tuition for two years only allows for the activists to graduate,” Stewart said. “It also leads you to believe that the current situation is acceptable, but it’s not. Where can we begin to organize to put political pressure on those who make those decisions?”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jared Daniels said the UC creating a three-party system, under which funding methods are different for UC campuses, California State campuses and City College campuses, created a hierarchal system rather than facilitating collaboration between students.</p>\n<p>“Before this tri-party system, universities were a free-for-all, competing against one another for the funds the state could give them,” Daniels said. “So in 1960, the UC President and state government came together and passed what was known as the ‘master plan’ which established the three-party system based on accessibility and quality.”</p>\n<p>According to Daniels, the master plan did not provide long-term sustainable resources for revenue, and President Regan’s economic policies required students to pay for education as opposed to the government providing public education.</p>\n<p>“We were just always hoping that California taxpayers would be willing to pay higher taxes for the system and we always figured the politicians would find the money,” Daniels said. “But obviously that’s not quite the case.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA policy analyst and fourth-year political science major Brett Carpenter said the UC is admitting a greater percentage of students from out-of-state to increase funding.</p>\n<p>“We’re admitting more and more of them into our schools each year,” Carpenter said. “That’s because we get a lot of money from them and the out-of-state tuition goes straight to the campus. There is a very identifiable incentive to take more of those people.”</p>\n<p>According to Carpenter, privatization of universities devalues a Bachelor’s degree, making it difficult to get a job after graduation, which incentivizes students to pursue post-undergraduate education.</p>\n<p>“The UC really has no interest in getting you a job after graduation,” Carpenter said. “Why? Because you can come back and pay them for a Master’s degree. They want to provide us with the lowest cost education they can while extracting from us the most money.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63467\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63467\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/","id":2748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2747,2746,2745],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
