UCSB was able to jump out to an early lead in the top of the fourth as Wisdom blasted a three- RBI home run to left field.</p>\n<p>With her 10th home run of the season, Wisdom became just the fourth Gaucho to ever record double-digit home runs in a single season. The home run was also Wisdom’s 30th of her career, which ties her for second place all-time in program history with Tiffany Wright.</p>\n<p>Senior utility player DeJanee Moore would later hit an RBI single in the same inning to give the Gauchos a 4-0 lead. However, Long Beach State would get a run back in the bottom of the fourth and go on to put up four runs in the bottom of the fifth to notch the victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman Lena Mayer was handed her eighth loss of the season after giving up four earned runs in 4.2 innings. Sophomore Christina Clermont picked up her 20th win of the season for Long Beach, giving up only six hits though seven innings.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s late game, the Gauchos took an early 2-0 lead following an RBI single from junior catcher MeShalon Moore and an RBI double from Wisdom. This would be the one and only time the team would score, as the rest of the game went entirely in favor of Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State combined for 18 hits in this one, and the team put up at least one run in every inning except for the fifth. Junior Ashley Ludlow was handed her 20th loss of the season for the Gauchos after giving up six earned runs in 2.1 innings. Long Beach senior Amanda Hansen picked up just her fifth win of the season allowing two runs over six innings.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s opener, Long Beach state would open up a 7-0 lead through the first four innings of play. This left little hope for a Gaucho comeback, but Moore would hit a two-run home run in the top of the sixth to force the game to go to a seventh inning.</p>\n<p>There would be no seventh inning rally for UCSB though, as the Gauchos would go down in order. Ludlow picked up the loss for the Gauchos after allowing three earned runs in two innings. Clermont received the win after allowing just two runs on four hits through seven innings.</p>\n<p>While it was a disappointing weekend for the Gauchos, College Sports Madness named sophomore outfielder Kristen Clark, sophomore outfielder Jacqueline Hinojosa, junior infielder Arianna Palomares and Moore to its All-Big West teams on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Clark and Moore were selected to the first team, while Hinojosa and Palomares earned second team accolades. Clark finished the season with a team leading 69 hits and a .356 batting average. Moore hit .345 this season and drove in a team-leading 42 RBI.</p>\n<p>Hinojosa led the Gauchos with a .367 batting average .483 on-base percentage. Palomares finished the season with a .335 batting average and led the team with 14 doubles.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Coming off one of her best performances of the season against UC Irvine, it would be crucial for her to replicate a similar effort in order for UCSB to come away with the victory. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Cal State Fullerton, they were paced by redshirt sophomore Raina Perez who was on fire in the first quarter. Perez scored 10 points, including two three-pointers, to help put her team up one going into the second quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB would play a very well rounded second quarter as they were able to outscore Fullerton by four points in the period. With no turnovers in the second quarter, Santa Barbara was able to score fairly easily behind strong play from Miller who had two three-pointers in the period. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it was a strong quarter for the ‘Chos, Fullerton was still shooting 60 percent from the field which meant that UCSB would have to lock in defensively to keep them from continuously scoring easy baskets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third quarter was much of the same for both teams as they were both able to score without much resistance. Cal State Fullerton had eight more free throw attempts than Santa Barbara which could be attributed to them constantly putting pressure on the basket. CSUF’s senior Jade Vega got to the free throw line six times in the period and made all of her shots to help tie the game heading into the fourth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton was able to take over the game in the fourth quarter behind strong play from senior Hannah Thompson who erupted for 10 points in the period alone. At the four minute mark in a one-point contest, they would go on an 11 to nothing run to seal the win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller struggled mightily in this period as she went two for eight from the field, including one for seven from behind the three-point line. With UCSB lacking production from their most consistent scorer, it made it difficult for them to keep up with a red hot Fullerton squad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSUF ended up shooting 59 percent from the field in the final quarter compared to a lowly 31 percent for UCSB, which was the reason why Santa Barbara was outscored by 12 points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for the gauchos to be able to close out similar games in the future, they will need a second scorer to emerge behind Miller. Sophomore point guard Danae Miller has shown flashes throughout the season but has been unable to be consistent throughout the year.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In UCSB’s wins, both Millers have not only played outstanding but have also provided important leadership to their younger teammates. It will be important for them to continue being vocal as the season comes closer to an end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just four games remaining in conference play, the gauchos will look to gain some momentum and improve their seed in the conference tournament which is coming up very soon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara is back in action at Long Beach State this Saturday, where they will look to pick up their fourth conference win at 4 p.m. at the Walter Pyramid.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-86435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-22/gauchos-struggle-from-field-fall-to-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-86435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-22/gauchos-struggle-from-field-fall-to-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-22/gauchos-struggle-from-field-fall-to-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-22/gauchos-struggle-from-field-fall-to-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-22/gauchos-struggle-from-field-fall-to-csuf/","id":1115,"author":{"id":32,"name":"Kunal Mehta"},"related":[1114,1113,1112],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop First Match of the Year Versus No. 7 UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-07-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-07-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Upon the completion of Saturday’s meet, UCLA managed to hand Santa Barbara its first loss of the regular season by a final tally of 5-2.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68683\" style=\"width: 496px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68683\" data-attachment-id=\"68683\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-01/no-27-ucsb-edged-in-home-opener-vs-no-70-pacific-rebound-against-fresno-st/nicolas-moreno-de-alboran-returns-the-ball-jenny-luodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTennisVSFresno-20160228-JennyLuo-07-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Nicolas Moreno de Alboran returns the ball.

UCSB found an early lead through their success during the doubles portion of the competition.

The Gauchos still remain first in the Men’s Big West standings, as they hold a one conference win lead over second place rivals Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The Sunset Canyon Recreational Center, in Los Angeles, was the venue for plenty of sets for elite collegiate tennis. The event started with the Gauchos claiming the first victory of the day, with Simon Freund and Morgan Mays.</p>\n<p>This doubles sensation was recently highlighted for their national recognition and the recent string of consecutive successes in season/tournament play. They claimed a 6-3 win over their Bruin opponents of Martin Redlicki and Evan Zhu.</p>\n<p>Redlicki previously won the 2016 NCAA doubles final alongside teammate Mackenzie McDonald. So the learning curve Redlicki is still adjusting to alongside his new doubles partner, Zhu, can be observed.</p>\n<p>The following match was the second, of three, doubles with the final result ending in a 7-5 advantage once again in favor of UCSB.

Wisdom would visit three more doctors seeking a second, third and fourth opinion, but the news only got worse. An MRI had discovered that she no longer had cartilage in her left elbow and, just like that, her pitching career was over.</p>\n<p>“It was heartbreaking to hear the news,” Wisdom said. “Not being able to pitch and control the game truly felt like the end of my softball career.”</p>\n<p>Wisdom began her playing career as a young girl, following in the footsteps of her sister. Her talents became apparent early on as she participated in club softball and eventually went on to play for her high school team.</p>\n<p>At Elk Grove High School, Wisdom batted .462 in her senior season with 21 RBI and 11 triples. She posted a 0.81 ERA and held opponents to just a .133 batting average. These efforts culminated in leading the Elks to a second place finish in the 2010-2011 Sac Joaquin Division I Championship.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Brie Galicinao knew that Wisdom was something special after watching her in her sophomore season at Elk Grove. From that point on, Galicinao made it a priority to get her on the roster.</p>\n<p>“Through the recruiting process we knew she was going to be a program-changer,” Galicinao said. “With her, I knew I’d have to work on that mental aspect and on harnessing that competitiveness.”</p>\n<p>This competiveness is what makes Wisdom such a premier example of what it means to be a great athlete. It is not simply accomplishments, but perseverance through adversity that help define what it means to be great. Wisdom has stood in defiance of circumstance and found new ways to achieve.</p>\n<p>“I lost the love of the game a bit [when I found out I couldn’t pitch], but I reminded myself that I play to compete and play to help my team,” Wisdom said. “I hope to help lead this team by example.”</p>\n<p>The road back on the field was not easy for Wisdom. While the injury prevented her from dominating on the mound, it also hampered her ability to throw the ball in the field. After failing to throw the ball with any velocity from her newfound position in the outfield, it was decided that Wisdom would have to become a permanent designated hitter.</p>\n<p>However, this, too, was not without its challenges. The pain still lingered throughout the injured arm and it was in question whether there would be any remnants of the power hitter that Wisdom once was.</p>\n<p>Prior to injury, Wisdom was a career .283 hitter and had launched 20 home runs in her three years on the team. She sported a career .479 slugging percentage as well. With pitching out of the question, her bat would be more important than ever.</p>\n<p>Wisdom put the fears and doubts to rest in a hurry though by flashing some incredible numbers at the plate. She is currently posting a .293 batting average and ranks first on the team with a career best nine home runs and .586 slugging percentage. She is also second on the team with 30 RBI and has two triples to her credit.</p>\n<p>Not only is Wisdom leading many offensive categories for the Gauchos, her season has landed her in the top 10 in numerous offensive categories in the Big West. She is tied for eighth-best with 10 doubles this season, and her two triples are tied for fourth.</p>\n<p>Wisdom is also tied for ninth with her 30 RBI and ranks sixth with the .586 slugging percentage. Possibly most impressive, though, is that she holds the third-best mark in the Big West with nine home runs and counting.</p>\n<p>All of these offensive accomplishments have once again made her one of the most dangerous hitters in the conference.</p>\n<p>“I have really tried to do my best at the plate and I am trying to focus on the positives of the situation,” Wisdom said. “I have really high expectations and I expect to do well every time I get the opportunity to hit.”</p>\n<p>Wisdom has embodied the hard work and determination that it takes to excel as a student athlete. She has rewritten the history books and left behind a legacy that is sure to withstand the tests of time.</p>\n<p>“It will be kind of sad to go into this last series against Long Beach State,” Wisdom said. “I don’t really know how to take it, because it will be my last series ever playing softball.”</p>\n<p>As Wisdom ends her career at UCSB, she simply wishes to be remembered as the determined softball player who let nothing stand in her way. She recounts her love of playing the sport and all that has come with it.</p>\n<p>Leaving behind something that has meant so much for so long is sure to be tough on anyone, but in athletes like Wisdom, that love of the game never fades away.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 7, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63130\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/shelby-wisdom-feature/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63130\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/shelby-wisdom-feature/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/shelby-wisdom-feature/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/shelby-wisdom-feature/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/shelby-wisdom-feature/","id":1114,"author":{"id":66,"name":"Martin Cobos"},"related":[1113,1112,1111],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
