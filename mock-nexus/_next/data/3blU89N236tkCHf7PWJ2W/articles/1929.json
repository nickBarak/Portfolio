\r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years later, the United States remains somewhat of a laughing stock in the footballing world, struggling to impose their style of play on games against teams that are clearly superior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the national team’s most visible struggle under Klinsmann, and something that continued in its three losses to Colombia and Argentina in the Copa América.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After exiting the Copa at the semifinals in a pretty embarrassing display against Argentina — the U.S. didn’t even get off a shot in the match, resulting in a 4-0 loss — now is as good a time as any to reconsider the future of the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the weeks leading up to the tournament, the manager’s job was coming under question with the expectation that Klinsmann would likely be relieved of his duties should he prove unable to lead his players through a deep run at the cup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quite a bit of it is always results. We take time after every major competition to reflect on that competition and what led up to it. It’s not a single game, or a single result. It’s where the program is and how comfortable we feel in the direction that it’s going,” Gulati said to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ussoccer.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after hiring the German.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This pragmatic approach is a perfect system of reevaluation for the president of a national FA. If the head of U.S. soccer still holds these beliefs, then he needs to really contemplate whether or not Klinsmann is the man to truly evolve not only the on-field results of the national team, but the general view of the sport in a country that’s just now starting to latch onto the beautiful game as a national passion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klinsmann has surely brought more stability to the national team setup, consistently selecting the same core players since he took over as boss, including German-American recruits John Brooks, Jermaine Jones and Fabian Johnson, all players that have proven themselves as some of the most talented athletes to represent the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistency and stability over time, though, fade into redundancy, and Klinsmann has failed to improve results in his five-year tenure. If Gulati honestly surveys the competition at the U.S.’s last two major tournaments, a semifinal appearance in the Copa América is almost less impressive than advancing from the 2014 World Cup’s “group of death.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, in the two years between the tournaments, there has been little to no improvement in the team’s roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where is Julian Green, who in one of his only chances with the national team scored a brilliant volley on Belgium’s Thibaut Courtois? Where is Juan Agudelo, who, last year against Mexico showcased technical ability on a level that is nowhere to be found in Klinsmann’s current “preferred” side?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the biggest question of all: Where in the world was young starlet Christian Pulisic at the Copa América, who was given all but a half hour on the field throughout the entire tournament?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let it be known that zero other Americans have the quality to make the first team at Borrusia Dortmund, and Pulisic is much more than a part player in Thomas Tuchel’s squad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 17-year-old was eased into the team with substitute appearances in the Bundesliga, but over the course of the season, solidified his role as an impact sub coming in on the wing for the German league runners-up, even grabbing a couple goals in key matches during his team’s title race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The argument that Pulisic couldn’t fit into the starting lineup for the U.S. is absurd; when a player has the pace, ability to take on defenders and talent to pick out a pass in the attacking third for one of Europe’s finest clubs, he has the quality to start every game for the USMNT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s most shocking about how Klinsmann handled Pulisic’s first major exposure to the senior national team, though, is how he seemed to tiptoe around the subject in press conferences, as if he was afraid of Pulisic gaining too much fandom so early in his career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America undoubtedly has struggled with overhyping under-talented players, namely Freddy Adu, but when a young man shows the promise of becoming a truly world-class footballer, playing time never hinders growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Klinsmann opted for more established players such as Gyasi Zardes, Michael Bradley and Kyle Beckerman against Argentina showed a lack of boldness when facing Messi and co. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting back and defending was never going to beat the top-ranked South American country, but still, Klinsmann was afraid of making a change that may yield criticism upon failure, almost like he was trying his best to save his job.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When he was hired as the new manager of a long-term project like the U.S. men’s team in 2011, he promised an injection of youth, but six of the starters versus Argentina were 30 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. soccer has stagnated, and Klinsmann is to blame as much as anyone. With the next World Cup in two years, now would be the perfect time for Gulati to cut his losses with the German and hire a new, more daring coach who offers a higher ceiling for the national team as it fights through qualifying for Russia.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71791\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71791\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-02/red-flags-surround-klinsmanns-tenure-with-the-usmnt/","id":1929,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1928,1927,1926],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns","biography":"Not available","articles":[1401,1404,1408,1409,1412,1413,1414,1416,1417,1418,1420,1422,1424,1427,1429,1432,1433,1435,1438,1439,1440,1446,1453,1454,1456,1458,1491,1492,1493,1904,1916,1929,1972,3308,3321,3335,4837,5028,5029,5031,5033,5034,5035,5036,5037,5038,5039,5040,5043,5045,5050,5052,5053,5054,5056,5057,5058,5059,5060,5061,5062,5350,5366,5694,5703,5705,5706],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"The Freak is Back","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lat-sp-tim-lincecum-angels-wre0039352412-20160623.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lat-sp-tim-lincecum-angels-wre0039352412-20160623.jpg?resize=650%2C366&ssl=1","description":"Tim Lincecum has made his way back to the MLB and with a strong outing in his first appearance in an Angels uniform, staff writer Antonia Bird believes the Freak is back.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At just 5 feet 11 inches and barely over 165 pounds, major league pitcher Tim Lincecum does not appear to be an imposing figure on the baseball mound.

Gregory Bull / Associated Press</p></div>\n<p>As dominating as The Freak was during his six-year reign, the last year of his career was anything but. He struggled with his control in 2015, and his once vaunted high 90s fastball had lost its punch.</p>\n<p>He was giving up runs in bunches, and the losses began to pile up as a result. He eventually lost his job in the starting rotation and questions swirled about whether he had reached the end of his career.</p>\n<p>Lincecum soon found himself out of professional baseball after not resigning with the Giants at the end of the 2015 season.</p>\n<p>In the offseason, doctors discovered a problem with the former two-time Cy Young winner’s hip. After a successful procedure, baseball writers quickly started presuming maybe the hip was the problem all along. Hopes began to rise that maybe Lincecum could dominate the big leagues once again.</p>\n<p>While recovering, Lincecum only thought about his comeback. He spent countless hours rehabbing his injury, attacking his regimen with the fearlessness that marked his professional baseball career.</p>\n<p>He worked hard, trying to find The Freak within his game yet again and fighting to bring himself to the level at which he expected himself to be. Slowly, he was able to take the mound once again. The velocity on his fastball improved, his control became more consistent and he soon began looking like a major league pitcher once again.</p>\n<p>In May of this year, he held a showcase for all major league teams, asking only that they give him a chance to prove his talents yet again. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim liked what they saw and took a chance, signing him to a one-year contract later that month.</p>\n<p>On June 18, Tim Lincecum completed his comeback and took the mound in Oakland against the Athletics. All the previous years’ hard rehabilitation process had led to this moment, and the Washington native did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>In a six-inning effort, Lincecum picked up his first major league win since June 27 of 2015 after allowing only four hits and one earned run while striking out two batters. The six innings were the most he had pitched in a single outing since June 5 of last year as well.</p>\n<p>His hip showed no signs of lasting damage and he attacked major league hitters in a manner reminiscent of his glory days with the Giants. In his first major league game since being cut by the Giants, Lincecum proved he is well on his way to becoming a quality major league pitcher again.</p>\n<p>It looks like The Freak is here to stay.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Messi has certainly made mistakes before, yet this mistake leaves Messi reconsidering his entire future. Should this one mistake cause Messi to retire from his national team and international soccer?  He seems to think so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While he will continue to play club soccer for Spanish champions FC Barcelona, he will be dearly missed on the global stage and Argentina national team, as he was an idol to many across the world.</span></p><div

will soon rule on the legality of the program. </span><em>Jessica Ko / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the direction of UC President Janet Napolitano, the UC Regents filed a lawsuit in September 2017 challenging President Trump’s announcement that he would end the program and took its stance as a defender of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a UC-wide service to help undocumented students: the UC Immigrant Legal Services Center. Based out of UC Davis, the program places an attorney at each UC campus who is available for legal assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the legal assistance, each UC has set aside resources for undocumented students, each with a program tailored to the needs of their respective campus. At UC Santa Barbara, this support comes from the Undocumented Student Services (USS). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, located on the second floor of the Student Resource Building,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was officially established in 2014 through funding from the Office of the President set aside specifically for undocumented student services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diana Valdivia, coordinator for Undocumented Student Services, works with seven student interns to help undocumented students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been working around undocumented students for five years, and prior to that I was organizing DACA legal clinics,” Valdivia said. “The passion of working with immigrant communities and having a masters in student affairs when these positions opened up were part of the reason for my interest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia has seen exponential growth in undocumented student services over the past three years in particular — both from overall growth of the new program as well as from heightened concerns from immigrant students when it was announced in 2017 that DACA would be rescinded, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When DACA was rescinded… we were seeing students [come in and] worry about, ‘What does that look like?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia’s goal with Undocumented Student Services is to provide a “different narrative” for the greater campus about what it means to be undocumented. Last year, USS hosted seven separate trainings for people to learn about laws and policies impacting immigrant communities, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, each year during the third week of winter quarter, the center puts on an annual Immigration Awareness Week on campus, where it hosts a series of events to provide outreach about how to support the UCSB immigrant community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The services also offer a faculty mentorship program, which connects undocumented students to other students and faculty members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have socials for students, and then faculty also come to the socials, and then students get a chance to interact with them more in an informal mentor role,” Valdivia explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia sees the connection between undocumented students and the greater UCSB population as beneficial to everyone, particularly as the Supreme Court goes through the DACA hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times media might be focusing on the trauma, what it means to be undocumented and that’s totally valid,” Valvidia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s important] for us to be able to provide a different narrative.”</span></p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
