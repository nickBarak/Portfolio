In addition to the electric chargers, there are 34 stations on campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Each two-space charging station costs approximately $10,000, according to James Wagner, program manager for transportation and parking services. The university pays an additional $250 per year for each space in network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university may also install charging stations in parking lot 31 at the end of the calendar year after assessing the total costs of the project.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many university staff and faculty members charge their vehicle while at work if they do not have an electric car charger at home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Rates for the charging stations vary depending on their location and power level. Level one is the most basic power level and level two is six times as powerful as the first level, Wagner said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Level one power is $1 for every four hours, with a 12-hour maximum. Level two power costs $1 per hour with a 10-hour maximum in most parking structures. Level two power in Lot 60 costs $0.20 per kilowatt hour.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the university primarily relies on grants to fund the charging stations.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Organizations such as the California Department of Energy, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Green Initiatives Fund of UCSB provide the funding.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The vehicle charging stations are not a source of revenue for the university, Wagner said, adding that the fee users pay to charge their vehicles is distributed to the stations’ maintenance, payment processing fees and the network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB housing and dining services installed the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in Lots 58, 59 and 60.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the charging station installation process does not take longer than a week, especially if the underground wiring is already in place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to data collected by the university’s transportation and parking services department, the use of electric energy has steadily increased since they were first installed in 2012. This year, approximately 125 megawatts hours (MWh) were distributed by the electric vehicle charging stations.</p>\n<p>According to the California New Car Dealers Association’s quarterly report released in May 2017, 4.8 percent of new vehicles registered in California in the first three months of 2017 were zero-emission vehicles and plug-in hybrids.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Correction: </span><span class=\"s1\">The university pays $250 per year in network connection fees, not electric connection fees, as the article previously stated. The article was also corrected to clarify that energy is measured in megawatt hours, not megawatts per hour. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> </span></em></p>\n<div

August 2016 after the university opened a Title IX investigation against him. The university opened the investigation after it discovered a 19-second video in which Doe and his ex-girlfriend argued on camera before the screen went black.</p>\n<p>University officials said the video “amply justified” Doe’s suspension while the university conducted a Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>Doe filed a complaint against the university in December 2016 to remove the interim suspension and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned to school in April</a> 2017.</p>\n<p>Judge Thomas Anderle of the Santa Barbara Superior Court ruled against the imposed suspension in the March court order, citing the university’s concealment of evidence as a cause and calling the university “seriously prejudiced” in its actions.</p>\n<p>“This court disagrees with UCSB’s claim that the University’s use of the detective’s summaries in issuing the interim suspension does not violate his due process rights,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “John Doe is entitled to know all the information against him at the hearing, not via emailing his counsel allegedly critical and decisive information at a later time.”</p>\n<p>Bob Ottilie, Doe’s lawyer, submitted an amended complaint to Anderle in July alleging that the university concealed evidence from Doe and violated his right to due process.</p>\n<p>According to the court order and complaint, former director of judicial affairs Sandra Vasquez withheld two police emails from Doe during a hearing with him on Sept., 22, 2016 that the university used in the investigation. One email included statements by third parties attributed to Doe’s ex-girlfriend, Jane Doe.</p>\n<p>Anderle found that the university never contacted Jane Doe to corroborate the statements.</p>\n<p>After the hearing, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn made the decision to continue Doe’s suspension until the conclusion of the Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>The court received the evidence in March days before a court hearing on March 21. At the hearing, Klawunn said under oath she had considered the two pieces of concealed evidence in making her decision.</p>\n<p>The university declined to comment on the case.</p>\n<p>Vasquez has since left her position at UCSB and is now the dean of students at Pitzer College. Vasquez could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In an email to the Pitzer student body in August in response to allegations of concealing evidence from Doe, however, Vasquez said she has “never concealed material evidence in any case.”</p>\n<p>Anderle also said in the court ruling that the university took too long to investigate, the<em> Nexus</em> reported in April, failing to conclude the Title IX investigation within the 60 calendar day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60 business day deadline required by the university.</p>\n<p>The Title IX investigation is still ongoing, and the university has not placed charges on the student or interviewed any key witnesses.<br>\nThe judge also ruled that the university caused Doe “irreparable harm” in barring him from the majority of his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he is “confident” Doe’s record will ultimately be cleared due to the evidence in support of the student and Judge Anderle’s ruling in March.</p>\n<p>“If charged and convicted, we are just going to go back to court with the same record and the same judge and ask the judge to throw it out — which we’re confident he would,” Ottilie said.</p>\n<p>In a letter from Ottilie to the UC Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, Ottilie expressed concern that the university mistreated Doe through the suspension because he is a minority student and unable to legally contest due to lack of financial resources.</p>\n<p>According to the March court ruling, Doe has incurred more than $100,000 in attorney’s fees since his filing in December. Ottilie said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday that Doe is currently unable to pay the expenses.</p>\n<p>The United States Department of Education accepted the case for further investigation of potential Title IX and VI policy violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Department of Education’s website, Title IX “prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex” and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition

id=\"caption-attachment-78989\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">While the SB fire department typically gets 15 to 20 fire alarms per month, they were alerted to 12 fire alarms in a 10-day period at the beginning of Fall Quarter. / Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Twelve fire alarms went off between Sept. 24 and Oct. 3, according to Mike Eliason, SB Fire spokesperson. On average, the fire department typically responds to 10 to 15 fire alarms per month.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said the fire department responded to 51 calls on campus and in Isla Vista in the same time period, 39 of which were emergencies and 12 of which were alarms.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said the increase in alarms could be attributed to the increase in people using campus facilities, although there is no “long-term discernible pattern” as to why alarms go off as often as they do. According to Eliason, most calls happen on Friday and Saturday night in I.V.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Eliason said fire alarms are often triggered in various ways. One fire crew member claimed a spider had even triggered one alarm.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There have been times where literally a spider crawls up inside and sets off a sensor,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The fire department responded to two calls provoked by the smell of dust from a construction site on campus Tuesday. During the school year, alarms are often set off by burnt popcorn or rice in communal kitchens.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There are more people using hot plates [and] making microwave popcorn than in the summer,” Eliason said in an email. “Take for instance yesterday’s call with the dust. In the summer, someone might not have been there (as it turned out) to pull the alarm.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The only damage in these situations is “slight embarrassment” for the person who pulled the alarm, Eliason said, but it is best to be cautious.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We do not mind responding to these calls, that is why we are here, to serve the public. We send a lot of resources to calls, because we can always turn them back if they aren’t needed,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said pulling false fire alarms “very rarely occurs” at UCSB. Pulling a false fire alarm in California is a felony and can include a punishment of imprisonment, a fine of no less than $500, no more than $10,000 or both, according to state law.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Annual Fire Prevention Week is Oct. 8 to 14 and the county fire department’s focus this year is preparation, according to Eliason.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Every second counts in a fire, he said, and can “mean the difference between residents of our community escaping safely from a fire or having their lives end in tragedy.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To prevent fires, the county fire department recommends drawing a map of one’s home and marking two exits for each room, as well as a path outside.</p>\n<p>In the event of a fire, the fire department also recommends closing doors while evacuating a building since it can possibly slow down the spread of smoke, heat and fire. Numbers on your home’s apartment should be clearly marked so firefighters may easily locate a fire when it occurs.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/spike-in-fire-alarms-emergency-calls-after-first-week-of-school/","id":2364,"author":{"id":86,"name":"Jose Ochoa"},"related":[2363,2362,2361],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"G.O.L.D.

The university released the current version of G.O.L.D. in the beginning of 2006, and the website has not undergone changes since its launch.</p>\n<p>The new updates will make the website more compatible with mobile phones and alter the color scheme and design to align with other websites, such as the official university <a href=\"https://www.ucsb.edu/\">website</a>, which is clearer and more modern than the current G.O.L.D. site.</p>\n<p>“We made attempts to make it look and feel like a UCSB site. Right now, it’s kind of its own thing,” said Anthony Schmid, the Associate Registrar for Information Systems.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the Registrar has been working on the updates for approximately one year. The mobile version of the website will be completed by the end of the calendar year, as the Registrar has decided on the appearance of the website and is waiting for developers to edit and test the site.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the changes will make G.O.L.D. “more manageable” for students to access the website on their phone. He said approximately 44 percent of the 4,864,849 times G.O.L.D. has been accessed in the past year has been through mobile phones.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I try to access G.O.L.D. on my phone to check things, it’s a bit of a pain to navigate and have to pinch and zoom to see anything,” Schmid said.</p>\n<p>The Registrar is also making adjustments to the “Graduation” page on G.O.L.D. to be more straightforward and is redesigning the “Advanced Course Search” function, Schmid said. There is not a set date for the completion of these projects.</p>\n<p>University Registrar Leesa Beck also said the Registrar is interested in making it easier to find and use degree audits to help more students understand their academic progress and graduate on time</p>\n<p>Schmid said, however, that the university is focused on updating the “look and feel” of the website before altering its functionality.</p>\n<p>Student Information Systems and Technology provides support for the Registrar’s websites and estimates the total project will cost between $15,000 and $20,000, depending on the amount of additional work needed based on the site testing.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, students have created their own extensions to the G.O.L.D. website unaffiliated with the university. An application called GauchoMap launched on Oct. 2016 on Google Chrome that allows students to locate their classes on G.O.L.D. in an interactive map.</p>\n<p>Students have shared information about the application on Facebook groups such as Free &amp; For Sale, a page on which students can buy and sell items like clothes and furniture. According to the Google Chrome web store, the application currently has 274 users.</p>\n<p>Schmid said students also added a Rate My Professor extension to the website, which lasted for approximately two years. He said the university is not concerned with the student-created extensions unless the extensions use the UCSB name and seal.</p>\n<p>Schmid said while the Registrar has not received any vocal complaints about the G.O.L.D. website, the Registrar wanted to upgrade the appearance of the site to keep it up-to-date with modern standards.</p>\n<p>“We figured it was time to move into the 20-teens [of technology],” Schmid said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/g-o-l-d-prepares-mobile-updates/","id":2363,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2362,2361,2360],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
