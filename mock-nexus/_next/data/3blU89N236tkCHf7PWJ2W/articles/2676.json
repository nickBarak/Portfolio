The demonstration was successful in gaining cooperation from UCSB administrators. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Five months after students gathered for a 13-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office to present 13 demands regarding campus sexual assault policy, administrators are continuing to collaborate with students on various improvements to support survivors and punish perpetrators.</p>\n<p>The May sit-in led by student group #NowUCSB, formerly “It’s Not On Us, It’s On You,” resulted in Yang agreeing to consider a list of 13 demands, including stricter punishments for offenders, improved sensitivity training for faculty and staff and greater diversity among on-campus aid groups and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP). The farthest-reaching policy change from the demands is a UC-wide requirement in June for all faculty and staff to undergo sexual violence and consent training. Other changes include increased sexual assault training for IVFP deputies and advertising for the Sexual Assault Survivor Fund on campus, which provides financial support to survivors to cover immediate expenses.</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB leader and third-year Chican@ studies major Alejandra Melgoza said while an estimated 95 percent of the demands are in progress, the bureaucracy involved with certain demands has caused delayed implementation.</p>\n<p>“So many survivors for so many years have been waiting for these changes to happen, and, right now, we have policy demands that we have to make happen,” Melgoza said. “Because of all the red tape we have to go through, it will take a long time.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said while the support of students and staff pressured the administration to make changes, ongoing education is still necessary to the movement’s success.</p>\n<p>“I have been very grateful for the support from Associated Students, faculty, staff, grad students and workers across the campus,” Melgoza said. “It has made an impact, and people are aware of it, but it’s very important to highlight to the new incoming class. They need to know what happened last year so that they can support it.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said with the start of the new academic year, more students will become involved in the campaign.</p>\n<p>“There has been progress on many of the thirteen demands, though we have been waiting for students to return to get their feedback and involvement in several of the demand areas,” Fleming said in an email. “I am hoping to see a diverse group of students established with whom staff and administrators can meet on a regular, perhaps monthly, basis to discuss issues of sexual and interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>#NowUCSB’s first three demands, which request students found guilty of sexual assault be immediately suspended for a minimum of four quarters and removed from campus, have to be approved by UC Office of the President. According to Fleming, the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault will soon release updated UC-wide policies.</p>\n<p>“There is a system-wide committee that is part of President Napolitano’s Taskforce on Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault that is about to issue new UC adjudication and sanctioning guidelines, so the Office of Judicial Affairs is waiting for these guidelines to inform any changes related to adjudication of sexual assault cases and disciplinary sanctions,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>UConsent coordinator, Take Back the Night co-chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan said the University is “dragging their feet” in addressing students’ demands for improved sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anyone is surprised that the university has delayed putting the demands into effect, given their history of handling cases of sexual assault and their initial resistance to these ideas,” Morgan said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morgan said she is hopeful the demands will soon be implemented.</p>\n<p>“I think [administrators] are beginning to realize that by helping this forward, they are paving the way for the UCs in terms of sexual assault reform,” Morgan said in an email. “I’m hoping that this notion, along with constant pressure from those involved, will get these demands implemented within this school year.”<br>\nAccording to Melgoza, there is still a long way to go before survivors of sexual assault receive sufficient support from the University.</p>\n<p>“These are the lives of students; their power was taken away,” Melgoza said. “It’s important to acknowledge that fact and make sure those survivors are given that power again.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, October 8, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Co-chair and third-year global studies major Unique Vance said many students feel it is acceptable for them to borrow from other cultures because they view themselves as “colorblind.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of people don’t want to recognize race or racism even though the dynamics are still there,” Vance said. “Instead, they’d rather say ‘Oh I don’t see color, so it doesn’t matter if I wear this or do this and that; I’m showing respect.’”</p>\n<p>Vance said students need to be open to criticism from minorities who feel their culture is being appropriated.</p>\n<p>“If somebody does come talk to you or call you out on cultural appropriating their culture or another culture, don’t just close your mind to it,” Vance said. “Don’t just think people are attacking you, because it’s a really big issue.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65877\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1679167283\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65889\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65877\" data-attachment-id=\"65877\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/workshop-aims-to-educate-on-cultural-appropriation/culturalappropriation_by-riley-esguerra-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Riley Esguerra\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445926356\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CulturalAppropriation_by Riley Esguerra-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65877\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CulturalAppropriation_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65877\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riley Esguerra/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to Vance, white people are routinely praised for cultural appropriation, and elements taken from minority cultures often become popularized by white celebrities.</p>\n<p>“All these cultural hairstyles and clothes from people of color are becoming mainstream and accepted now [that] they’ve been put on white models or actresses or celebrities, like the braids and the cornrows,” Vance said. “There is a different perception of that compared to a black person wearing it.”</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E.

three-floor residence for visiting scholar physicists located adjacent to the San Clemente Villages, scheduled to open late next year.</p>\n<p>American businessman and philanthropist Charlie Munger donated $65 million to be used for constructing the Visiting Scholars Residence, a 75,000-square-foot building located on El Colegio Road west of San Clemente apartments. The Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP includes meeting rooms, shared kitchens, dining rooms, a gym and 61 apartment style, fully-furnished private bedrooms with private bathrooms. The residence will also house a flag hall to display national flags of current visiting scholars. Construction began October 2014 and the Visiting Scholars Residence is planned to open late 2016. KITP is a research facility created in 1979 which hosts programs such as Deconstructing the Sense of Smell and Dynamics and Evolution of Earth-like Planets.</p>\n<p>KITP residence manager James Brill said he currently collaborates with visiting scholars to coordinate housing in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara. According to Brill, he contributed to the layout design of the Visiting Scholars Residence and attributes the success of the construction to Munger’s donation.</p>\n<p>“We had a very informal rental program … so as a result, years ago, they really thought about making some sort of residence,” Brill said. “Then, as we kept adding more and more scientists, it became a definite need, and then just last year Charlie Munger decided to give us a very, very generous grant to build the residence.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the residence will accommodate visiting scholars at UCSB as well as their families.</p>\n<p>“We’ve designed a lot of the rooms to be family friendly — we have like a child’s play room and we want to make sure nothing is stopping you from coming and being as productive as you can possibly be while you’re here,” Brill said.</p>\n<p>According to Brill, the meeting rooms allow visiting physicists to interact off-campus and to conduct their work in their living setting.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got everyone working on a program, you’re all together, which is something the physicists really wanted,” Brill said. “It’s really nice that you can do a lot of intensive work no matter where you are.”</p>\n<p>Brill said the exterior of the Visiting Scholars Residence for KITP is meant to resemble Santa Barbara architecture.</p>\n<p>“Because we have such a big international group, we tried to tie it into the construction that we have in Santa Barbara … we want it to fit into the aesthetic of the neighborhood,” Brill said. “The main goal of KITP is to get people from all parts of the world to get together.”</p>\n<p>Director of KITP and professor of astrophysics and cosmology Lars Bildsten said KITP hosts programs year round to “capture frontier topics” and provide a venue for open discussions.</p>\n<p>“The major thing that the KITP provides for the university is a huge flock of physicists that come for long periods and interact mostly with each other, but most of our activities are open to the campus,” Bildsten said. “So we get a lot of physics graduates students, mathematical graduate students, biology students who come and interact with the visitors.”</p>\n<p>UCSB professor of biophysics and KITP permanent member Boris Shraiman said KITP is a “fantastic” place physicists can visit to be inspired.</p>\n<p>“[The] new residence will allow our physicists to stay together and keep working and thinking about science 24/7,” Shraiman said. “It will become immediately an attraction and I expect to go there in the evening to hang out with the scientists.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Talks Live in New York City on Nov. 2 in Town Hall Theater to discuss the “Education Revolution.”</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on reforming education curriculums in public schools to better serve marginalized, “at-promise” students. Rios said he was motivated by his personal journey in overcoming adversities to research the education systems within public schools and their effects on marginalized students.</p>\n<p>According to Rios, the T.E.D. Talk will focus on his work in developing a curriculum for high school “push-outs” who have been victimized and criminalized by schools.</p>\n<p>“They get punished overwhelmingly, they get reported to police, they get told ‘you’re not allowed in school’ because they’re truant,” Rios said. “They end up in the streets and become vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>Rios said many struggling high school students receive mostly informational support from teachers and emotional support is largely overlooked.</p>\n<p>“We just see you as a student, an empty container to be filled with knowledge, that doesn’t have anything to offer me as an educator except to sit there and take notes,” Rios said. “Right now, a lot of emotional connection is lost in the educational system.”</p>\n<p>Rios also said he wants to advocate for educational curriculum based on restorative justice rather than punishment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to teach kids a lesson when they mess up is to give them love, connection, emotional support and, of course, holding them accountable,” Rios said. “We need more restorative justice.”</p>\n<p>Last April, Rios spoke at T.E.D.xUCSB, a locally organized T.E.D. event featuring UCSB professors from various departments. In his talk, Rios said the generation currently in higher education is sometimes considered the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic,” but he does not believe this to be true.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Also at the T.E.D.x event, Rios said educators need to employ a more emotional method when teaching the millennial generation, as it is more focused on personal connection and social impact than generations before.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>According to Rios, presenting in New York will be an important opportunity to convey his message about education reform.</p>\n<p>“I have the potential to leave a message to the world about how we could help kids that are on the street corners lost, kids that are abused, kids that society has forgotten about, kids that have been called criminals and thugs,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Second-year undeclared major Navid de Leede said Rios’s sociology class encouraged him to take action to improve the educational achievement gap at his old high school.</p>\n<p>“We went to Professor Rios’s office hours and asked him, because what are you gonna do with a problem that’s been ingrained for years in our specific hometown?” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology student Anthony Lavezzo said Rios helped jump-start the educational program with de Leede at his high school.</p>\n<p>“He was more like guiding us rather than pushing his own philosophy. He gave us recognition after we developed our project,” Lavezzo said.</p>\n<p>According to de Leede, Rios spoke extensively about educational inequality against under-privileged students during his lectures.</p>\n<p>“We learned that he was very passionate about not leaving students behind because of their financial situation or their socioeconomic background,” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/","id":2675,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2674,2673,2672],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
