Thirty six died and nearly one hundred were injured across the three mass shootings, which all happened within the span of a week.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gathering was organized over Facebook by Armbruster-Sandoval and Amanda Pinheiro, a graduate student in the UCSB Global Studies department, less than 24 hours earlier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcus Lopez, a local activist and Chumash native, opened the vigil with a blessing and performed a native healing song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees were invited to step forward and speak their minds. Most messages centered around community and a common humanity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that power is found in the community,” one attendee said. “We must stand together as a community. It is the answer. We must demand from politicians the responsibility to act. When we get there, we’ll be back as humans together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are no agendas here tonight other than the human agenda,” another gatherer said, alluding to the political nature of the debate that has sparked across the country in response to the three shootings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emiliano Campobello </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a UCSB alumnus, local activist, co-chair of Santa Barbara Standing Rock Coalition and co-founder of The Climate Mobilization’s Santa Barbara County chapter </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> condemned the racist motivations of the El Paso shooter who opened fire at a crowded Walmart. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shooter admitted to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/us/el-paso-suspect-confession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“targeting Mexicans”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and, in his manifesto, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/politics/trump-mass-shootings.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the “attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Donald Trump, who has </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/11/business/media/el-paso-killer-conservative-media.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referred to the northern migration of asylum seekers from Latin America as an “invasion,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been criticized this week for similarities between his words and those of the shooter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House right now is really disturbing,” Campobello said. “Now, are we going to have to be afraid to be brown and go to Walmart?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campobello, who is also a professional muralist, musician and descendent of the Yaqui and Huichol tribes, performed a song on the Native American flute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Music gets past the mind,” he said. “Language kind of gets stuck, even if the words have certain meanings. Music and melodies… get into the heart space. And as that space can open up, we can tap into a field of love. And that is what we really need right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others reflected on their hope for future action to prevent such tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think hope is sometimes the only thing that we have to hold on to,” said one attendee. “But it is powerful. Because hope can lead to action. If we all put in our little piece of work, we can transform our communities, we can transform our state, we can transform our country. You each have a lot of power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see an awakening,” said Campobello. “People are less able to remain complacent and are being called to action because things have been so bad. That’s where I see hope.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89519\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89519\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/","id":2014,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[2013,2012,2011],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers","biography":"Not available","articles":[2002,2014,4149],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Honors for Who?

But now, at the end of her second year, she does not believe that the program was made for people like her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man,” Eseka said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her experience with the Honors Program underscores an issue that has loomed over the department’s staff for years — the program’s demographic fails to reflect the diversity of students that exists in UCSB’s student body as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2018-2019 school year, UCSB boasted one of the most diverse student bodies of any college in the nation, snagging 14th place in “Best Ethnic Diversity” among public national universities by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US News &amp; World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/019172/top-five\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advertised by the university at the time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But the Honors Program told a different story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost half of the 1,713 students in the honors program in 2018-19 school year identified as white or Caucasian, despite white or Caucasian students making up only about 30% of the total student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicanx/Latinx and Black/African American populations in the Honors Program represented less than half of their respective proportions in the student body, according to numbers from UCSB’s Office of Budget &amp; Planning in the 2018-19 school year. Chicanx/Latinx students made up about 12% of the Honors Program compared to 29% of the student body; Black/African American students made up about two percent of the Honors Program compared to five percent of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-KN8eC\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of UCSB Undergraduates Campuswide vs. in the Honors Program, 2018-19\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KN8eC/3/\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Stacked Column Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of nearly 40 Black students in the program, Eseka doesn’t always see diversity at program activities, such as honor seminars, and she said the university could be doing more to support people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chance of me being the only Black person in that class is really high and sometimes maybe as an honors [student], you might get second looks, like ‘Are you in the right place?’ and you have to be like ‘Yeah, I am,’” Eseka said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Eseka, feeling comfortable in the Honors Program is key to recruiting and retaining people of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Diversity is really necessary to encourage more people to come to the program and then to stay in the program, so you don’t feel lonely or feel left out or singled out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of the new honors students enrolling for the 2019-2020 school year, diversity statistics aren’t improving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the incoming group of freshmen – the class of 2023 – invited to join the Honors Program, almost half of the students are white. Chicanx, Latinx and African American students collectively make up less than 10% of the honors-eligible students. </span></p>\n<p><iframe id=\"datawrapper-chart-eoOjm\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ethnicity of Incoming UCSB Freshman Admitted to the Honors Program, Fall 2019\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eoOjm/6/\" height=\"458\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}();</script></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeffrey Stopple, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education, is one person in the honors departments who has kept the issue of diversity on his radar. When he first started to look more closely at the honors department about three years ago, Stopple noted several concerns with the way the program had been functioning, particularly with how the program included and supported diverse student populations at UCSB.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a high rate of attrition, of students not staying in the program. There was also a concern that the program didn’t represent the diversity of UCSB [because] it was not particularly diverse,” Stopple said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But three years since Stopple’s arrival, the diversity of students in the program still lags behind the diversity of the campus as a whole. Stopple said his office has worked in several ways to modify the program to support students of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those efforts is the collaborative Q&amp;A panel discussion put on in May 2019 by Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the honors department. Over a hundred first-year students who were on track to meet the honors requirements were invited to attend the information panel to hear from current EOP honors students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said the panel, which he started in 2017, has been effective in recruiting more diverse students to the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eseka spoke alongside Stella Delgado, a UCSB third-year history of public policy and anthropology double major, as panelists during the event. The two discussed EOP students’ concerns about the “intimidation” factor of the Honors Program. Some students felt the “elitist” reputation of the Honors Program was something that gave them reservations about applying, Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Delgado, the program’s lack of diversity points to “the different challenges students of color face on campus and the different challenges students from lower-income communities also face.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a student of color and a low-income student, I’ve had to maintain having a job for most of my time at UCSB, which has taken away from academics,” Delgado said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can enter the program in two ways: by being invited into the Honors Program when admitted to the university or by applying to the program the summer after their freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising sophomores are required to adhere to a 3.5 GPA and 36 letter-graded units requirement to enter the program, Stopple said.  Students can apply for the program in July and are admitted so long as they meet the GPA and unit requirements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple said GPA is a “crude” metric and that he “would prefer to do something different.” But for now, due to “limited resources,” the honors department cannot incorporate more criteria for their application process besides the “purely quantitative” measures currently in place, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple did, however, lower the GPA requirement for the honors program from 3.6 to 3.5 in June 2017 in order to include more students in the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several advantages that come with being in the Honors Program; one, Stopple said, is having priority enrollment, which allows honors students to be among the first to enroll in classes during pass times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other advantages that come with being in the Honors Program include access to special academic advising, extended library privileges and academic and community service opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The promise of one-on-one time with professors, building relationships for letters of recommendations and beefing up resumes with honors status draws many students to the program. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the truth that when you think of honors, you think of really, really smart, and who is usually seen as really smart? It’s not necessarily, ‘oh, the Black girl.’ It’s [the] white man.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michelle McKee, a recent graduate of the Honors Program, said “it’s very hard to get one-on-one time with the professors and to really talk with and work with the professors” without having the advantages of the Honors Program.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She joined the Honors Program after her freshman year and said the perks benefitted her education at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The day-one pass time is a plus,” she said. “But I also just knew that there were a lot of great opportunities if you were involved in the Honors Program including these really cool honors seminars and I’ve just been able to take so many interesting classes that I wouldn’t have taken otherwise.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB honors student, Michael Stallworth, said his experience in the Honors Program helped him get settled into the university and allowed him to “work with other people who are like-minded and just want to… achieve as much as they can.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stallworth noted that a diverse honors program would indicate a university that adequately supports students of color and students from unique backgrounds, something still in the works at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just shows that we have people from different communities who are able to be successful at UCSB and still be able to take advantage of the opportunities that are offered,” Stallworth said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the experience of each student in the Honors Program varies, many agree that increasing and supporting diverse populations in the program remains an important goal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know how much more opportunities and advantages I get being in the Honors Program between volunteer opportunities, earlier pass times, separate advisors,” said Zeina Safadi, an honors fourth-year political science major. “And so it would be disheartening to think that it was only to a specific group of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Eseka said the root of the problem is in the way minority students perceive the Honors Program, and given the unique challenges they already face at UCSB, honors could be exactly what these students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You hear honors [and] you think ‘I’m not meant for this,’ not because you don’t have the credentials, but just because… historically, as a low-income first generation minority, you’ve…  had so many barriers that have prevented you from getting here faster or at the same pace as others.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Eseka, the Honors Program makes achieving her academic and career goals a little bit easier. The distinction of being in the Honors Program in college is an edge that she said she needs to accomplish her goals after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s one reason why I keep on going because I know I’m gonna hit so many barriers. It’s just gonna make it one less hoop.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Members of BUS flew to meet Rising in San Diego, where he was living after prison, to convince him to enroll in San Diego Community College and start his own chapter of Underground Scholars there, but multiple hurdles sent Rising on a detour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising curbed his drug use after taking a class in prison on the pharmacology of drug abuse, but he was still admitted to rehab after leaving prison. He soon left, walking away from an offer to work at the facility so that he could go to school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But upon arrival, Rising instantly felt out of place. While in class, the insecurities of his “tatted up” appearance and his age — a decade older than most — spiraled him into dejection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to quit. I didn’t feel like I belonged. So I called Martin [Vela-Sanchez] up at Berkeley Underground Scholars and he goes ‘Flaco, just do 90 days [at the college]. Do 90 days and shake as many hands as you can and you’re going to see that people were there that went through the same exact thing you did,’” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Three years later, I’m getting my associate’s degree, the first person in my whole entire family to get an associate’s degree, to get any college degree at that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While in community college, Rising learned to embrace his differences and founded the Urban Scholars Union, a support group for formerly incarcerated students. But two years wasn’t much time, Rising said, and following graduation, he was looking to establish something bigger: “I beat prison and I used school as a platform to end the cycle of recidivism, I found a way out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an associate’s degree under his belt, Rising began scouting universities to continue his education. He had applied to four UC schools — UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley — along with the University of San Diego and was accepted to all of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After visiting UCSB, Rising was sold — in part, he said, because there was no Underground Scholars program here. He felt a calling to carve out a program from scratch, despite everyone at UC Berkeley that was “waiting for [him].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Berkeley has Berkeley Underground Scholars, UC Irvine has UC Irvine Underground Scholars, UCLA has UCLA Underground Scholars, UC Santa Barbara has nothing and neither did USD,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He hopes to make his own mark on the campus with the creation of such a program, one that would be the first of its kind at UCSB. Operating like most others within the UC system, UCSB Underground Scholars will support students released from prison in an effort to guide them through their educational experience and walk away with a degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been trained by my mentors — the other students who have come before me — who paved the way so there’s a blueprint that can be implemented to actually help other formerly incarcerated individuals,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I came [to UCSB] with this blueprint in hand, like ‘Hey look, there’s a bunch of formerly incarcerated students that are going to get out with their associate’s degrees and they’re going to have their 60 units credits and they’re going to be wanting to come here.’ What are we going to do to prepare to receive them?”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising said he is currently working with the Office of Admissions, the Educational Opportunity Program, the Transfer Student Initiative, Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead and other Underground Scholar programs, in addition to seeking out a space on campus to house the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although still in its early stages, Rising already sees the potential of having a space for formerly incarcerated students on campus. By extending a hand to someone who could use help in school, like Rising himself, he said the initiative is a way to break the tumultuous cycle of the prison system, where many individuals often end up back behind bars because they never had the opportunity to pursue higher education.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From correctional facilities to college, we’re focused on helping people come back out and re-enter through the college system because we’re set up from the gate, we’re set up to fail by probation and parole,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got all these stipulations that are thrown on us. They put us in these re-entry homes that are in the ghettos with drug dealers and drugs around them. And they know that we’re gonna fail and they know that we’re gonna recidivate right back in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising embraces his past, not only to use it as fuel for his ambitions, but also to show people like him that a life outside of prison is completely possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m promoting college and I dub it as being a ‘gangsta nerd.’ I’m still that gang member. I still represent East LA, but I represent it in a new way,” he said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rising, two million incarcerated individuals in America is too high of a number for the country “that celebrates freedom the most.” His solution extends beyond UCSB, where he hopes to see more unity in communities that are hurt the most by crime and incarceration. Oftentimes, he said, it’s the absence of a legacy to aspire to that sends people to prison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rising, it’s the prospect of leaving a legacy for his children that motivates him to continue helping formerly incarcerated students as an advocate for education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My children have been through a lot, their dad hasn’t always been there, I’ve been incarcerated,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But now, my daughter wants to go to college,” Rising said. “My son, he wants to be an author.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m building a legacy for them to follow.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
