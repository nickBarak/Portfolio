The loss was the first given up by UCSB to Northridge in Santa Barbara since the 1999 season.</p>\n<p>In a battle between the two best offensive teams in the Big West, the Matadors struck first on a shot by junior forward Beto Velasquez. Dribbling down the right sideline, Velasquez cut in and shot the ball on the ground, through sophomore keeper Austin Mansker’s legs and into the back of the net to give Northridge a 1-0 lead 31 minutes into the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We were playing with a defense that at best is extremely tired (from playing on Friday),” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The goal we gave up was on a guy picking up the ball at half field and running 50 yards. That was disappointing.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the two teams shot an equal 12 shots, but UCSB was unable to convert any of its chances.</p>\n<p>“This [loss is] disappointing because I feel this is one we needed to win,” Vom Steeg said. “It was at home and yes, Northridge is a good team, but I knew today with our forwards attacking their defenders we would get four or five excellent opportunities. We needed somebody to step up and finish, and we didn’t get that.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s 2-1 double overtime thriller against Irvine, Ryan propelled UCSB to victory, scoring both goals for the Gauchos, including the game winner with just 24 seconds remaining. The win gave UCSB its first victory against the Anteaters since 2009.</p>\n<p>“As soon as [Ryan] got that goal, [I knew] it was by far the best win since I joined the team,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started the match strong, dominating possession. Yet, despite outshooting Irvine 8-4 in the first half, it was the Anteaters that got on the board first. On a counterattack, sophomore forward Lester Hayes III cut inside toward the goal and shot from just outside the 18-yard box. Hayes converted, putting the Gauchos down 1-0 to the lowest-ranked in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“For me, it was way too easy of a goal,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Just over three minutes into the second half, senior forward Dion Acoff passed the ball to Ryan, who fired the ball into the far top corner of the net, tying the score 1-1.</p>\n<p>“What I said at halftime is that we’re not going to get shut out tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “We pushed a lot of players forward. We just needed one goal to change the momentum.”</p>\n<p>With time dwindling in the second overtime, Ryan took over. After taking a corner kick, which was then deflected back out to him, Ryan crossed the ball back into the box. It bounced twice in the box before passing an outstretched Irvine keeper and settling into the corner of the goal.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB outshot Irvine 21-13. Ryan led the attack for the Gauchos taking five shots, three of which were on goal.</p>\n<p>“He put the team on his back and gave us victory,” Baiden said. “He played well the whole game. He was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/","id":1632,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1631,1630,1629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman","biography":"Not available","articles":[109,168,169,170,509,510,511,515,516,520,521,522,526,534,536,537,540,542,543,544,547,549,550,552,553,556,557,562,563,564,566,569,571,572,573,575,579,580,582,586,587,588,590,591,593,602,604,606,607,608,611,612,615,616,617,619,620,621,622,624,625,626,628,629,631,632,634,636,639,641,642,643,644,645,646,649,652,664,665,666,667,669,671,676,678,680,685,686,688,690,692,695,697,698,702,704,705,707,712,713,714,715,720,722,723,726,729,731,732,734,735,738,741,744,745,751,753,755,758,760,763,768,769,771,772,773,775,776,777,778,782,789,790,794,795,797,802,803,805,807,808,812,815,816,817,818,823,836,840,842,928,929,930,931,932,933,935,1053,1054,1055,1056,1057,1058,1059,1060,1061,1062,1067,1068,1069,1094,1095,1592,1612,1613,1614,1615,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1622,1625,1632,1634,1636,1640,1643,1653,1658,2051,2064,2067,2094,2104,2114,3174,3181,3182,3184,3193,3206,3208,3211,3212,3213,3227,3237,3254,5109,5110,5199,5200,5201,5202,5203,5204,5205,5206,5207,5210,5378],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Gauchos Play Final Home Matches of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/CedarLay_WSoccer_8_24_2-111.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/CedarLay_WSoccer_8_24_2-111.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"In desperate need of a win after a disappointing two-game road trip last weekend, the UCSB women’s soccer team returns to Harder Stadium this weekend to face the University of Hawaii and Cal State N...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In desperate need of a win after a disappointing two-game road trip last weekend, the UCSB women’s soccer team returns to Harder Stadium this weekend to face the University of Hawaii and Cal State Northridge. With this home stand being the last of the season, UCSB plans on feeding off the home crowd atmosphere and hopes to send off its seniors in winning fashion as they play in their final home games of their careers.</p>\n<p>Still without a conference victory four games into league play, the Gauchos record stands at 3-9-2 overall and are in eighth place in the Big West at 0-3-1. Coming off two tough losses against Long Beach State and UC Irvine, UCSB has lost five of its last six games and understands this home stand can make or break the season.</p>\n<p>“These last few games mean absolutely everything for us to make it into the Big West [Tournament],” senior midfield/ forward Dyanne Anderson said. “We need to win every game from here on out to even have a shot at making it into the Big West Tournament; I think we can win these last five games.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UC Santa Barbara will bid an emotional farewell to three seniors: midfielder/defender Erin Ortega, who has started for the Gauchos since her freshman season, Anderson, who has been with the program for two years, and forward Lauren Kennedy.</p>\n<p>“It would mean everything to me [to win] because this is my last time playing at this home stadium,” Anderson said. “It means absolutely the world to me. I think it will be really emotional because I think it is just going to absolutely hit me; it hasn’t hit yet that season is coming to an end and soccer is ending.”</p>\n<p>Despite having an offensive resurgence and scoring at least one goal in five consecutive games, defensive mishaps have been the Gauchos’ main fault. In its last six games, the backline has been exploited for 15 goals. Hawaii (6-6-2 overall, 1-2 Big West) is coming off a split of two conference matches, a 2-0 victory over UC Riverside and a 1-0 loss to Cal State Fullerton in double overtime that snapped its 12 game home-winning streak. UCSB will try to take advantage of a tired Hawaii team that will have to fly to Los Angeles and then drive to Santa Barbara. In its last 19 road matches, the Rainbow Wahine have struggled, going 2-17 and is 1-5 on the road this season.</p>\n<p>Condering the Rainbow Wahine rank third in the Big West in goals per game at 1.57, tiring Hawaii out could serve as a huge advantage.</p>\n<p>“The fact we have them here at home really kind of helps us,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “They have to take a trip to the airport in Hawaii, they have to take a five hour flight and they have to drive two and half hours to get here from LAX. [We have to] try and take the game to them because they’re going to be tired with all the traveling.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will then host the Matadors (5-4-4 overall, 2-1 Big West) on Sunday, who have played impressive soccer in their conference so far. The Matadors easily defeated UCR 3-1 in its last game and lost 1-0 in overtime to CSUF last Friday. However, CSUN will have to travel to Santa Barbara after playing a tough Cal Poly team on Friday.</p>\n<p>“They’re having a great year … they have a couple great results; they’re coming here with two conference wins,” Stumpf said. “Luckily they have to play at Cal Poly on Friday so hopefully they have a hard time up there and come to us a little tired.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offense will really need to kick into gear if the Gauchos want to give its seniors a win in its last game at Harder Stadium.

Despite leading Long Beach and UCI at one point in each game, it was a tale of two halves for the Gauchos as they faltered in the second half of each match.</p>\n<p>The two losses this past weekend drop the Gauchos’ record to 3-9-2 overall and 0-3-1 in conference. Already four games into conference, the Gauchos’ chances at making a playoff run are in trouble, as they are still without a conference win and have only won one game in their past seven matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB travelled to Anteater Stadium on Sunday, where they have been winless since 2005, but got off to a strong start on Sunday as freshman midfielder/forward Angelisa Cortez’s goal put the Gauchos ahead five minutes into the match. It was Cortez’s second goal of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lead was short-lived, though, as Santa Barbara gave up a goal in the 24th minute to go 1-1 at the half and then allowed a goal one minute into the second half. UCSB was not able to respond to the Anteater attack and gave up a foul inside the box in the 82nd minute.

Just two minutes later, the Gaucho defense let up again and a crucial foul proved to be costly, as Mendiola lost her defender and scored a header on a free kick to give Long Beach a 2-1 win. The 49ers dominated the second half, outshooting UCSB 13-2 in the half.</p>\n<p>“The girls played beautifully in the first half … I don’t know what happened in the second half,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “The goals we gave up were mistakes, [which is] really tough.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/","id":1631,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1630,1629,1628],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Rival Cal Poly in Last Match of Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After two and a half months of disappointing but resilient play, the UCSB women’s soccer team will conclude its season this Sunday against rival Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.

Despite being in first place, Cal Poly still has not mathematically qualified for a spot in the Big West Tournament and the Gauchos will look to play spoiler, as a loss could endanger the Mustang’s chances of competing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“They do play a system where there are some pluses and minuses for us and against us, so we’re going to do everything we can to play to our strengths and avoid those weaknesses,”</p>\n<p>Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “It’d be great [to win]. They’re our closest rival, the schools are very similar — we recruit a lot of the same players. You always want to beat your cross town rival.”</p>\n<p>A huge reason Cal Poly is in position to capture its first Big West title since 2009 is freshman goalkeeper Alyssa Giannetti, who leads the conference with 6.65 saves per game and 113 overall saves. Santa Barbara plans on creating havoc in the box for Giannetti after scoring four goals against Fullerton and outshooting Riverside 13-5 in last weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to look up some game film and we’re going to come up with a system and style that is best going to suit us to have more of the ball,” Stumpf said. “Because of that, [hopefully we will] get some momentum and get more looks at the goal and hopefully stick them away.”</p>\n<p>Containing the Cal Poly offense will be a difficult task for Santa Barbara as the Mustangs enter with the No. 1 ranked offense in the league, scoring a conference-high 1.88 goals per game and 19 goals in total. Stopping freshman forward Elise Krieghoff will be top priority for the Gaucho’s backline. Krieghoff has top rank in the Big West in goals scored with 10 on the season.</p>\n<p>Despite having to settle for a record under .500, the Gauchos are still proud of what they have accomplished this season.</p>\n<p>“I think that our entire season we played really well; our record doesn’t show how hard we worked,” Mead said. “I’m really proud of the whole effort everyone has put in and just coming together as a team. It has been a very awesome year even though the record doesn’t show it.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Sunday’s Blue-Green rivalry match is set for 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48431\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48431\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-26/gauchos-face-rival-cal-poly-match-season/","id":1629,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1628,1627,1626],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
