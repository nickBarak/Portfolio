Although this season will only feature 48 games, it is proving to be worth the 119 day wait. The Blackhawks have earned a point in 28 straight games dating back to last season, making them tied for the second longest streak in league history. The Los Angeles Kings are playing very well recently, and Coach Darryl Sutter will have his team ready to defend Lord Stanley’s Cup. On the other side of the country, the fans in Pittsburgh are ecstatic to have Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin healthy and playing together again. These exciting storylines and record setting performances are crucial for the league to retain its integrity after an ugly offseason. Here is a review of some of the hottest teams and best players so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chicago Blackhawks</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just when it looked like the Blackhawks were finally going to lose in regulation this season, Patrick Kane netted a goal with 2:02 left in the final period of last Sunday’s game against the Red Wings. Then, Kane carried his team to a victory in an overtime shootout when he beat Detroit’s goaltender Jimmy Howard with a multiple-deke move.</p>\n<p>Kane is leading the team in goals, assists and overall points with 11, 15 and 26, respectively. If the Blackhawks continue their dominance and Kane keeps up this type of performance, he will be a strong contender for MVP.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goaltender Corey Crawford leads the league in average goals allowed with a stingy 1.41 per game. The Blackhawks also boast the best goal differential in the league at +29 and have allowed the fewest goals overall (41). Chicago plays will round out this week with two games against the Avalanche and one against the Oilers on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anaheim Ducks</p>\n<p>After missing the playoffs last season, the Ducks have played much better hockey so far this season. They are second in the entire league with 33 points and are 7-2-1 in their last ten games.</p>\n<p>They do not have a dominant offensive scorer, but they can pass the puck. Six players have eleven or more assists, and ten players have five or more goals. Captain Ryan Getzlaf leads the team in goals(8), assists(17), and overall points(25).</p>\n<p>As for the men tending the goal, Viktor Fasth is 9-1 with an average of 2.08 goals allowed per game. Also, veteran Jonas Hiller is averaging a surprisingly high 3.24 goals allowed per game. The Ducks have lost consecutive games to the Coyotes, 5-4 in shootouts. Their next three games will be at home against the Coyotes, Flames and Blues.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p>The defending Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings got off to a rough 3-7 start this season. However, Anze Kopitar and the rest of the Kings have won eight of their last ten games.</p>\n<p>Kopitar leads the team in points with 18, while fellow center Jeff Carter is first on the team and tied for second in the league with 14 goals. In the Kings 5-1 win over the Predators on Monday, Carter completed his fifth career hat trick with two goals within a 19 second span in the final period.</p>\n<p>After putting together one of the greatest post season performances ever last season, goaltender Jonathan Quick has struggled this season. He is a meager 6-6 this season and is allowing an average of 2.54 goals per game. Recently the Kings have been mixing in Jonathan Bernier between the pipes. Bernier is 5-1 this season as the goaltender and is allowing an average of 1.53 goals per game. The Kings have three more games on this homestand and then travel to play the Coyotes and Sharks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the Penguins have their superstars healthy and scoring the puck. As a team, they are second in the Eastern Conference and lead the league in average goals per game with 3.48.</p>\n<p>Sidney Crosby is leading the league in points with 36, and assists with 25. Right behind him is the Penguins left wing Chris Kunitz, who is second in the league with 28 points and first in plus-minus with 17. In addition to Kunitz and Crosby, they have seven other players with ten or more points this season. Left wing James Neal is tied for second in the league with 14 goals and Malkin is tied for fourth in the league with 18 assists.</p>\n<p>Their goaltender, Marc-Andre Fleury, is tied for the lead league in wins with 11 and is allowing an average of 2.44 goals per game. The Penguins are 7-3 in their last ten games and if their defense improves they will be a tough out in the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Montreal Canadiens</p>\n<p>The Canadiens are in first place in the Eastern Conference with 32 points. They are 7-3 in their last ten games and are allowing the fifth least amount of goals per game with 2.32.</p>\n<p>Goaltender Carey Price is tied for second in the league with 11 wins and tied for second in shutouts with two. After finishing in 28th place last season, the Canadiens have turned the page and are firing on all cylinders. In their game against the fourth place Bruins on Sunday, Montreal took advantage of the penalty on Boston’s key defender, Zdeno Chara, to take the lead for good in the third period.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ice, the Canadiens are led by left wing Max Pacioretty, and centers David Desharnais and Tomas Plekanec. They have combined for a total of 49 points this season and are distributing the puck nicely. After yesterday’s game against the Islanders, Montreal will travel to the Hurricanes, Lightning and Panthers this week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Leaders (as of March 4)</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<p>17 –

Sciences Librarian representing UCSB at the bargaining table, said in an interview with the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>“We worked diligently to come up with language that was equitable and we were working around issues that were pre-existing and known to the union because of grievances that had been filed relating to our current contract and now former contracts.”</p>\n<p>One of these grievances revolved around salaries.</p>\n<p>LaBonte said that many librarians felt their salaries from UCSB were inadequate when considering the high cost of living in Santa Barbara. LaBonte even thinks that some librarian job applicants ruled out UCSB as a viable option because of this inadequacy.</p>\n<p>“We’d hear feedback from people that would say, ‘well, I didn’t realize what the cost of living was like,’” said LaBonte, who took a 22% pay cut after coming to UCSB from her previous position as a librarian at California State University Channel Islands.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to attract people just because of the location, which is beautiful and amazing,” she added. “But if you don’t have the salaries to match it, people either won’t come or they won’t stick around for long.”</p>\n<p>To remedy this situation, the union reached a deal with UC that would guarantee an “annual increases for all represented librarians, with a total cumulative benefit of approximately 22-26% over five years,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians, another debated grievance, played a large role throughout the contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians are librarians who are only hired to work a set duration of time at their respective place of employment.</p>\n<p>Coinciding with an already high employee turnover, LaBonte said that she and other library representatives worked with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to improve the conditions of temporary librarians.</p>\n<p>Although the situation with temporary librarians was not completely resolved, the union, along with input from UCOP, was able to partially amend their new contract to prevent future abuses from UC libraries, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>“We tried our best to get some wording in for the issue with temporary librarians. UC occasionally hires temporary librarians and the contract says that it’s not supposed to be for permanent work,” LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>“When that person leaves, who is going to fill in the gap?” LaBonte raised about the issue.</p>\n<p>When a temporary librarian leaves, another one is hired to replace them. This process oftentimes repeats itself multiple times, depleting the library of resources used to rehire and train new librarians, LaBonte added.</p>\n<p>Similar to temporary librarians, academic freedom among UC librarians saw improvement, but was ultimately left out of the new contract. Academic freedom, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/position/academic-freedom\">union’s website</a>, “is based on the idea that the free exchange of ideas on campus is essential to good education.”</p>\n<p>After introducing academic freedom during the bargaining process, LaBonte said that UC immediately dismissed it, reasoning that academic freedom would not be a “good fit” in the contract.</p>\n<p>“That news rippled far and wide. I was hearing from colleagues all over the country that they had heard what was going on here. So that was also some bad publicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>Although academic freedom was left unincorporated in the new contract, Labonte claims that she and fellow union representatives reached a deal with academic freedom.</p>\n<p>“We did get [UC] to verbally agree that they would be incorporating the academic freedom policy protections,” she said, emphasizing that the inclusion of a verbal agreement was paramount, as “basically all of the academics on campus did not have academic freedom protection” until this new policy takes effect.</p>\n<p>However, in order for the academic freedom policy to go into action, it will still have to undergo a 90 day system-wide review, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Another component of the new contract was professional development. Although funding for librarians at UCSB is distributed on a per-capita (campus) basis, this was not a uniform practice, according to LaBonte. Other UC libraries distribute money on a first come, first serve basis, which she deems is an unfair practice to UC librarians.</p>\n<p>With the new contract, however, all UC libraries will operate on a per-capita basis, ensuring a fair and equal amount of funding is available to each library.</p>\n<p>LaBonte stressed the importance of this new practice, adding that this funding allows librarians “to go and present at conferences and participate with professional organizations.”</p>\n<p>Other small victories were piled into the contract as well, LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>For example, if a librarian falls ill during a vacation, they can opt to use sick leave instead of their vacation time. Also, librarians are now guaranteed up to thirty days of sick leave which can be used for “baby bonding”, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some demands did not get any ink in this cycle’s contract, and librarians will have to wait until the next round of contract negotiations for further demands to be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>Sabbaticals and eligibility for housing assistance programs, for example, were left unsupported by the new contract, as well as “grievability for denials of flexible work arrangements,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Overall, the union deemed this contract a success, highlighted by a post on their website: “This is not an April Fools joke! UCOP has been notified; the new MOU is officially in effect.”</p>\n<p>LaBonte emulated a similar sentiment, notably her enthusiasm for an overwhelming number of wins in this cycle of negotiations.</p>\n<p>When asked why she wanted to represent UCSB at the bargaining table, LaBonte’s answer was simple.</p>\n<p>“I got my bachelor’s degree here in geography in 1999. So I’ve been working in and out of this library since 1994. I love UCSB. I’m a lifelong Gaucho,” she said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yaeger has written several books about beer and is featured regularly in publications including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All About Beer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer Advocate</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and appeared on NPR’s Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[My love for beer] began back in my college career, and I just think that the craft beer industry and the beer styles that are available have matured,” Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just seems like the right time for the university to match the wine tasting class with the beer education class.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger was inspired to create such a class after he took a wine tasting class, also offered through the Rec Cen, when he was an undergraduate. He approached UCSB about teaching a class about beer last year, aiming to create one that would be on par with the wine class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took [the wine class] and I loved it, but personally I’ve just always been more of a beer drinker and a beer fan,” he said. “And all of the beer knowledge that I have amassed, I had to sort of undergo that research by myself, but it would have been great if I could have had a course like this myself to set me on the right path.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaerger, who is also verified on Twitter and is the author of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red, White, and Brew: An American Beer Odyssey,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> described his class as a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“way for people to really get their toes wet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you are a student… let’s just go with the premise that your alcoholic beverage consumption begins at 21 – we could put a little winky face in there. Any consumption that you may have experienced is more than likely enjoyed a very gregarious setting where the aim is to be social and not really thinking about the beverage,” he said, laughing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger explained that college drinking culture doesn’t necessarily foster active thinking about the beverage or its enjoyment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, when you’re playing beer pong or quarters or any of those games, you’re not really thinking about how much you enjoy a drink, or what it’s made from. You just know it’s wet, it’s cold and it’s gonna have an impact.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class is open to both students and the surrounding Goleta and Santa Barbara community for $90 for students and $95 for non-students but attendees must be 21 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class will interweave the history of beer with a series of tastings, which are arranged by country and region. For example, the first night will feature German or Continential Loggers, while the second will feature British ales, Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By the end, if you go to the supermarket or a bottle shop, and you see all the different brands in front of you, it’s not going to be strange and sort of foreign. You’re going to understand what those offerings are,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, attendees will taste close to 40 different kinds of beer and should bring at least two wine glasses or tasting chalices, as well as “palate cleansers” such as pretzels, bread, crackers and, of course, lots of water. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students must sign up at the Rec Cen Customer Service Center. Online sign-ups are not available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t have to love every beer I’m going to pour, but you have to understand that someone loves it. And that every person who takes this class is going to leave with a broader understanding and a passion for these styles that they just didn’t even know existed before,” Yaeger said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Because just a little over a week down the road begins the NBA playoffs.</p>\n<p>Slated to begin April 21, most teams have about seven games remaining in their regular season. This means crunch time for several teams looking to secure those last few playoff spots.</p>\n<p>In the East, the teams that will enter the postseason are pretty much locked up. After its 27-game win streak, the Miami Heat has secured the top seed in the Eastern Conference and probably in the league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Teams one through seven have guaranteed their spots in postseason play. The only team not locked in is Milwaukee, but with a six-game lead over ninth-place Philadelphia, there’s very little chance that the Bucks won’t be part of the playoffs.</p>\n<p>The rest of the teams may see changes in seeding, but overall, the East is set and should be very exciting heading into playoffs. While the conference will be Miami’s to win or lose (and it would be extremely surprising if they don’t win), seeds two through seven are all extremely competitive and should feature some very competitive series.</p>\n<p>The West, on the other hand, is a very different story.</p>\n<p>At the top of the conference, San Antonio and Oklahoma City are still neck and neck. Personally, I don’t really think it matters who wins the conference because in the end, the Thunder’s youth and athleticism will be too much to handle for even a great veteran team like the Spurs.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the Western Conference, though, features a very tight race for that coveted eighth spot. It looks like Houston will take seventh, but the fight for the last spot comes down to Los Angeles and Utah.</p>\n<p>The Lakers currently hold the eighth seed at 39-36. Just a half-game behind is the Jazz at 39-37, who would win the tiebreaker if the two teams were to tie.</p>\n<p>L.A. comes off a crucial victory Tuesday night against Dallas in which it won convincingly 101-81. The win was not only important to take the lead over the Jazz, but also created a two-and-a-half game gap between Dallas and a playoff spot, making it just a two-man race to enter the postseason.</p>\n<p>Utah has won five of its last six, but neither team has an easy schedule down the stretch. Utah has six games remaining, the Lakers seven, and both teams have only Western Conference teams remaining on the schedule. For both teams, the majority of their opponents coming up are seeded higher and they will play three of the same opponents, so in this case, the best team should win.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I give the advantage to the Lakers. The first reason is because they have more games at home to end the regular season. Los Angeles will play five of its final seven games at home, which gives it an edge over its tougher competition. Utah, meanwhile, will only play three of its final six games at home.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Lakers have Kobe Bryant. Love him or hate him, the guy knows how to play under pressure. He’s got six rings and I’m sure has no plans of sitting out the best time of the year for a pro basketball player.</p>\n<p>He’s averaging 27.0 points per game, third best in the NBA, and if it weren’t for his team’s subpar year that didn’t come close to meeting the large expectations put upon the star-packed Lakers, and LeBron James, Bryant would be considered in the MVP voting.</p>\n<p>For the most part, the team has gained all its pieces back too. Steve Nash continues to sit out with hip and hamstring injuries, but quite honestly, the Lakers are just as good without Nash as they are with him. Without Nash, Bryant becomes not just a scorer, but also the facilitator, and the Lakers have been very good when Bryant breaks into single digits in the assist category.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how the Lakers do with both Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol healthy and on the floor together, but in the end, the team just has too much talent. Someone (aka Bryant) will step up and lead the Lakers into the playoffs.</p>\n<p>Like in the East though, I don’t think it really matters who takes the final spot when it comes down to who will play in the NBA Finals. Oklahoma City and San Antonio will most likely be the two teams competing for the chance to play Miami, as they have been the superior teams in the West all season long.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for any teams at the bottom of either conference, this isn’t March Madness. It takes four games to defeat a team in a series and playing that one miracle game won’t get you very far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/the-nba-playoff-picture/","id":2114,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2113,2112,2111],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
