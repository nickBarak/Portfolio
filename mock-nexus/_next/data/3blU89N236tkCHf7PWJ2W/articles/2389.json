The cameras are purchased by the department and, according to Howard, typically cost between $300 and $1,200.</p>\n<p>There is not, however, a thorough policy in place that outlines the steps taken to install a camera, and the university is currently in the process of drafting a new policy for installing security cameras. The university’s latest policy was created in May 2008.</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said that under current policy, camera footage is accessed and monitored by each department that owns the camera. The footage is only released during police investigations or when there is compelling interest to uncover what was filmed.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the university is in the process of creating a new policy to specifically outline the regulation of camera use.</p>\n<p>“It’ll vary by various departments, and this is a reason why we’ve started the dialogue,” Hall said. “We want a policy that says, ‘If you’re going to manage a camera, there are practices and standards to which you have to adhere that balance privacy, safety and security.’”</p>\n<p>The group drafting the new university policy was created around four months ago and consists of law enforcement, university administrators, university staff members and Jennifer Lofthus, the chief of information and security officer.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President is also creating a new system-wide policy change.</p>\n<p>According to Hall, security cameras pose an “ethical burden” due to controversy between increasing surveillance and maintaining people’s privacy. He also described them as a “monetary burden” because individual departments pay for their installed cameras.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the installation of security cameras undergoes a different process for interior and exterior cameras, as “staff issues and union issues” may arise when such groups deny access to being filmed inside buildings.</p>\n<p>“We have to consider there are certain labor classifications that explicitly prohibit this particular thing,” he said.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants the future policy to include a requirement to attend a privacy training for those who request cameras to learn how “to respect the privacy of our community.”</p>\n<p>Many students may not be aware of security cameras, and Hall said the new policy will designate more signage to show students where they are being surveilled.</p>\n<p>Hall said he estimates that the policy will be completed by the end of the calendar year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get everybody to a similar standard,” Hall said. “The policy is deliberate and thoughtful, and we want to make sure there’s time for review and there’s time for dissemination and there’s time for criticism.”</p>\n<p>Ruby Stewart, a first-year psychology major, was studying on the fourth floor of the library when she noticed the security camera hovering above her.</p>\n<p>“I honestly didn’t know there was cameras,” she said. “I don’t feel uncomfortable, though, because I feel like it kind of makes sense. I feel like if they’re misusing it, just to kind of like, watch us, that’s creepy. But if they have like a purpose, then it’s fine with me.”</p>\n<p>Stewart said she thinks the cameras would be useful if there were a crime in the library, but she said students should be more aware of the cameras’ presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know … so obviously there should be more signs,” she said. “Because if you have signs, people will say, ‘Oh, there’s cameras, I shouldn’t do anything stupid in here.’”</p>\n<p>According to Gary Johnson, the associate university librarian for research and scholar services, there are cameras on every floor of the library, the majority being on the first floor due to the amount of general and emergency exits.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants to remind students that they are “under constant personal surveillance in the world,” and the presence of cameras on a university campus is typical due to the high volume of visitors and amount of expensive infrastructure and research equipment.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to clarify [students’] rights through policy,” Hall said. “The university has not only a right but a compelling interest in surveilling an area to make sure you’re safe and to make sure our property is protected.”</p>\n<p>Abigail Hunt, a first-year biology major, said she doesn’t mind having cameras on campus because they act as a “safety precaution.”</p>\n<p>“It makes me feel safe, like if something did happen they’d be able to record it,” Hunt said. “But I don’t feel the need to know where things are because I don’t feel like I do anything that I should worried about being watched.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

Here are highlights for answers to questions from the moderator, Mary Zhu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>CONNECTIONS:</b> Zhu asked the candidates if they have sustainable statewide networks to work with as EVPSA. Hsu cited her past three years of experience in A.S., specifically her involvement in the UCSB Federal Advocacy Program that sends students to Washington D.C. to lobby, which has established networks at the federal and UC level. Dagnachew said that as mental health coordinator, he helped start peer programs similar to UCSB’s at UCLA and UC Irvine. He said he has met other student leaders at U.S. Student Association (USSA) with similar if not the same goals for fighting tuition hikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>GRASSROOTS OR LOBBYING?: </b>Hsu said change comes with both lobbying and grassroots organizing and it is important to realize that students have different strengths in participating to voice their concerns. Dagnachew agreed that both lobbying and grassroots work are effective, and he said he wants to work toward having students see the connection with their own efforts to the actions going on at the state and federal levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>STUDENT ACCESSIBILITY:</b> In response to a question about increasing student accessibility to the EVPSA, Dagnachew said his involvement in various organizations, canvassing for student programs such as CLAS and working as a Resident Assistant have prepared him to reach out to students. Hsu said it can be a challenge to be approachable, but she hopes to focus on communicating legislation to students that is not always clear to understand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. elections began on Sunday and and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vise-president-of-statewide-affairs-debate-dagnachew-vs-hsu/","id":2388,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2387,2386,2385],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"External Vice President of Local Affairs Debate: Dumlao vs. Stoll","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0285-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0285-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Candidates for the Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs met Wednesday to contend why they are best qualified to represent students to the county on issues that include communit...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Candidates for the Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs met Wednesday to contend why they are best qualified to represent students to the county on issues that include community policing, tenants’ rights and sexual assault prevention.</p>\n<p>The election of this year’s EVPLA comes at a turning point in Isla Vista’s political history.

Elections Board and those anonymously shared from the audience.</p>\n<p>Here is a breakdown of the topics discussed in Wednesday’s EVPLA forum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>SAFETY: </b>Stoll said she is working to create a police collaborative board of law enforcement officers, community members and students who would meet to offer individuals the opportunity to voice their concerns to law enforcement in a formal setting so that issues are “transparent” and people can engage in open dialogues regarding them. Stoll added this board would allow the police to address community concerns directly in a manner that is open to the public. Dumlao said having more training for the police force in I.V. is a crucial part of how they interact with the community and the current trainings are insufficient. He added that C.A.R.E. training, LGBTQ training, a racial-sensitivity training and a religious safety training are all necessary to prepare them to engage with the diverse population in I.V. Dumlao also said he wants to create more of a culture of community policing because Isla Vistans are capable and willing to care for their community and “don’t need an extreme police force every time there is a huge event in Isla Vista” to keep the community safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>FIRST PRIORITIES: </b>Stoll said her first priority upon taking office would be to assist students struggling with tenants’ rights by creating an online platform similar to Rate My Professor but with profiles on landlords. On this site, students could discuss in an open forum issues relating to maintenance and legalities. She said she also aims to establish a community court in I.V. at which students could address minor misdemeanors instead of having to go to downtown Santa Barbara to deal with common tickets like minor in possession and drunk in public. Dumlao said his first priority would be to create sexual assault policies that serve the needs of survivors in I.V. and reverse the trend of incidents going unreported by working with the C.A.R.E. office and CSD to “empower survivors to come out and tell their stories and gain support.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>FAMILIES: </b>Stoll said the best thing to do to help the families living in I.V. is to support the CSD and all its efforts to bring them into the community because, as a representative of students, it’s not her position to support their needs directly. She said she would support the CSD board’s aims to create tenant mediation and translation services specifically designed for these families. Dumlao said the first step to helping I.V. families is to reach out to them to learn more about their needs, followed by further action to create a community culture that “revolves around safety and love.” He said he plans to foster this through mentorship programs and increased resources available to all community members, regardless if they are students, such as a food bank and C.A.R.E. offices.\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_77104\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77104\" data-attachment-id=\"77104\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/dsc_0081-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0081 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77104\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=700%2C467\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC_0081-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77104\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tatiana </em>Karme<em>-Scalisi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>PARKING: </b>Dumlao suggested establishing a UCSB shuttle system that would employ student workers and decrease carbon emissions, as well as designating a location outside of I.V. to park cars during Deltopia weekend, free of charge. Stoll said while one of the eight powers of the CSD is to create a parking program, she hopes to address the problem of overcrowded streets in I.V. more immediately by creating parking spots on the streets and developing alternate forms of transportation for students to deter them from bringing cars to I.V.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>HATE CRIMES: </b>Stoll said the best way to address hate crimes is to host open dialogues to break down walls within the community and increase transparency among all communities. Dumlao said there is no way to ensure LGBTQ students don’t experience hate crimes and that verbal violence affects all communities and can lead to physical violence. He said addressing a hate crime incident immediately will increase transparency, and making resources known to victims is important to demonstrate that “we don’t stand for it and that we are willing to talk about it.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>NOISE ORDINANCE:</b> Dumlao said a 10 p.m. noise ordinance through the weekend would not be a good idea because students need time to relax. He also said that, for many communities that are race-based, loud music and dancing are part of social gatherings. He added that the ordinance could increase tension between students and law enforcement and that there should be an emphasis on increased cooperation between neighbors regarding noise. Stoll said the county’s decision over summer to vote on the 10 p.m. noise ordinance without consulting student opinions is evidence of a “systemic problem” that has existed for decades, in which the county decides on policies for I.V. while students have no voice. She said working with the CSD will ensure that students are consulted by representatives to create continuity on policies that affect I.V. residents.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>COMMUNITY RESOURCES:</b> Stoll said she has discussed various projects with the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU), including a website to profile landlords and also a mobile application that lists students’ rights as tenants. On the app, students could upload a part of their lease to have an open dialogue and learn how to deal with problems with their landlords. “This is the first time they have probably entered into any kind of legal contract as an adult, and it’s really difficult to understand the legalities. There’s a lot of loopholes. I think landlords take advantage of the fact that students don’t really know what they’re doing,” she said. Dumlao argued that many students don’t have the option to access resources like IVTU amid their studies and jobs, so IVTU staff should go door-to-door to reach those people who are “not privileged enough” to access them on their own time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND FAMILIES: </b>Dumlao said being able to reach out to people who are undocumented to communicate to them their rights, with translation services available, is key because many members of the undocumented community don’t have the time to access the resources available to them. “They’re really just surviving on a day-to-day basis. Our job is to make sure they can thrive wherever they are living,” he said. Stoll said she would support efforts to create a sanctuary county in Santa Barbara because members of the undocumented community should be allowed to live their lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>POLICE BRUTALITY: </b>Stoll said the best means of addressing police brutality is to break down barriers between the community and law enforcement. She re-emphasized the importance of creating a police collaborative board. “We need to hold them accountable as people part of our community, but we owe them the benefit of the doubt as well … they are here to keep us safe at the end of the day,” she said. Dumlao again said one way to combat police mistreatment is to hold additional trainings for police officers. “The police do get paid to do their job, and we need to make sure we are giving them the resources to do their job as efficiently as they possibly can,” he said.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In each of their closing remarks, both candidates emphasized their dedication to working alongside the CSD board to create a strong and safe community in I.V.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she plans to address each of the issues in the I.V. community one-by-one in the most thorough way possible and will draw on her experience as an off-campus senator and a member of the CSD campaign.</p>\n<p>“Knowing our representatives [and] being a part of these community meetings, I feel that I will be the best person to represent student voices in our local government and in our county and make sure Isla Vista stays strong and stays safe and students are aware of their resources and representation,” she said.</p>\n<p>Dumlao emphasized that it is extremely important to him to ensure that all I.V. residents are welcomed and safe in I.V. by making sure that the the CSD hears marginalized students’ voices.</p>\n<p>“There are many communities in Isla Vista that don’t feel welcome and don’t feel safe all the time,” Dumlao said. “We want to make sure that Isla Vista is a place that we all feel loved.”</p>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. Elections began Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/external-vice-president-of-local-affairs-debate-dumlao-vs-stoll/","id":2386,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2385,2384,2383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Parker J.

His father said Parker expanded his knowledge of history through these conventions. The conventions were their tradition, and Rand said, “It’s gonna be tough next year knowing that I won’t share that with him.”</p>\n<p>Once he became a history buff, Rand said Parker was fascinated by the controversy and treaties that evolved from World War II.</p>\n<p>Parker’s favorite person in history was Winston Churchill, his dad said, and the two once visited Churchill’s secret subterranean command center on a family vacation to London. “It was tough to pull him out of there,” Rand said.</p>\n<p>Parker’s room was full of books, Rand said, and he particularly liked science fantasy novels. He loved “Star Wars” and was just starting to get into “Star Trek,” beginning with the T.V. show. “He wasn’t a big fan of the movies,” Rand said, describing Parker as a “purist” when it came to pop culture.</p>\n<p>“He was an old rocker at heart; he was a huge Beatles fan,” Rand said. The White Album was likely Parker’s favorite, and his dad said Parker once went out of his way to find the album for his younger sister. The album will be placed at his service on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“That’s the kind of thing he was doing. He was always looking out for others,” Rand said. “The caring person that he was, he always championed people that were left to the side and the people who fell behind.”</p>\n<p>A group of nearly 20 people from Adventure Programs held a memorial for Parker Monday at Campus Point, gathering next to a rental office where Williams worked and spent much of his time on campus.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77034\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1081213815\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77182\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77034\" data-attachment-id=\"77034\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/dustin-harris-daily-nexus-15/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77034\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParkerMemorial_DustinHarris-20170417-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A group of students from Adventure Programs gather around a fire at Campus Point to remember Parker J. Williams on Monday, April 17. <em>Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Huddled close to each other around a small fire, the circle took in the sound of crashing waves, wrote messages to Parker and chose to either toss in the notes or share their memories aloud.</p>\n<p>Several members of the group worked closely with Parker after he completed his Leadership Training Course last year and remembered him as diligent, careful person who had an “eagerness to do well for others.”</p>\n<p>“The world was better with him in it,” one friend said, adding that Parker had “a magical presence that made you feel comfortable.” Another recounted her shifts working the rental office with Parker, saying he made her a better employee and a better person.</p>\n<p>Rand shared with the Nexus a speech Parker presented at his Eagle Court of Honor ceremony. It is printed it here in its entirety:</p>\n<p><em>“Scouting for me was never about the Eagle. I’ve always been more enamored by the journey…Nothing can take from me the majesty of watching a sunset from the top of Big Bear Mountain, the calm of napping near a gentle creek in Whitsett forest, the rush of adrenaline from fighting white water in the Kern River Valley…Whenever I need a reprieve from life’s sad noise or dull hum, all I need to do is remember the beauty and vivacity of nature, and suddenly, I have the motivation to push on so that I may explore more of these unique paradises…what has made my time here (Scouting) truly enjoyable has been the time spent with friends.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’ll never remember the hundreds of conversations that were had, but I will remember the smiling and laughing, simply being content. An indicator of this is that no matter where we go camping, the heart of the trip always seems to be at night when we all gather around a campfire, a lamp lit table, or all cram inside one tent to play cards while laughing away the troubles we left at home. It is an innumerable amount of amazing memories…and each one I will look fondly upon for the rest of my life.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"738092682\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77182\"><img data-attachment-id=\"77201\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/announcement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?fit=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1152\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Announcement\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77201 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Announcement.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/parker-j-williams-was-history-buff-loved-nature-and-rock-music/","id":2387,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2386,2385,2384],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
