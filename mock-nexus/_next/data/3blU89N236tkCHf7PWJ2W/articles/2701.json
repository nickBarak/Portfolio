The bill successfully passed through the senate and currently awaits approval by Governor Jerry Brown, who can sign it into law. University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses currently have jurisdiction to expel, suspend or enact disciplinary action on students who commit sexual assault, but not the authority to punish students for incidents that happen off campus grounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson said the bill’s success was backed by the common understanding that all college students from UCs, CSUs and community colleges should be held accountable for crimes such as sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think, clearly, if everyone has to meet to the same standards, there won’t be the sense that someone can get away with something that another can’t,” Jackson said. “So there’s going to be accountability, and hopefully there will be disciplinary action in both circumstances.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jackson, the bill mandates punishments such as expulsion and suspension for students found guilty of sexual assault regardless of whether or not the incident happened within or outside of campus boundaries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will be monitoring this to make sure that disciplinary proceedings are effective and are pursued when there are allegations of rape and sexual assault,” Jackson said. “It is my expectation that I have discussed with the universities that they will follow this law and abide by it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) President Lori Gaskin said the unanimous passage of the bill gives the administration jurisdiction to punish crimes that happen outside of campus to ensure the safety of the student body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our first priority is for student safety,” Gaskin said. “We do not tolerate violations of our college student code of conduct on any of our three campuses, and this measure would extend that authority for sexual assault and other serious student misconduct outside our campus boundaries.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaskin said she hopes the concerns of students and administration will continue to be heard regarding issues concerning safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thank Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who proposed this specific bill, and will continue to work with our local elected officials to ensure safety on all our local college campuses,” Gaskin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Gaucho Consent coordinator and alumna major Lexi Weyrick said if community colleges have procedures in place to properly adjudicate accused students, then the bill is a “no-brainer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are agreeing to a code of conduct when they attend school, just like at UCSB, and if students violate that code, it is absolutely within the school’s rights to take action as they see fit,” Weyrick said. “This bill simply gives community colleges the ability to act within those rights in regard to sexual violence, which makes sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Weyrick, the bill will ensure both UCSB and SBCC students who live in Isla Vista are on the same page regarding discipline for sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think SB 186 opens the door for greater communication between UCSB and SBCC regarding sexual violence that occurs in Isla Vista which has been very inconsistent in the past,” Weyrick said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson said it is important to inform students of tolerable behavior, and SB 186 would hold students accountable for sexual assault just as they would be held accountable for academic issues such as plagiarism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of the whole issue here is empowering victims and educating students both male and female about what is acceptable and not-acceptable behavior,” Jackson said. “Colleges can expel students for things like plagiarism, so if they have the tools and procedures in place to deal with that kind of behavior, then they should certainly have the tools to discipline students for behavior as serious as rape or sexual assault.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Companies which provide services to the UC through contracting will also be required to comply with the new minimum wage policies. According to a UCOP press release, the cost of the wage increases will be covered by “non-core funds” such as bookstores and food services, which are separate from “core fund” revenue sources, which include tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifth-year sociology major Alberto Perez said the plan benefits full-time UC and UC contract workers, but excludes student workers who typically only work 20 hours per week at most while attempting to provide for tuition and living costs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For student workers, the UC has had this kind of unspoken rule that suggests students don’t work over 20 hours because it might cut into their schoolwork and education, which makes sense in most cases,” Perez said. “However, you have … students that need to work at least 20 hours to be in school in the first place.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the limitations of the new minimum wage hike and exclusion of certain employees have been overlooked in favor of “positive press” for the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So their motivation is trying to be the beacon of light,” Perez said. “The one minor detail that nobody really covered is that many employees are left out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President of the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW 2865) and graduate student at UC Santa Cruz Robert Cavooris said the UC has good intentions with the minimum wage increase, but the exclusion of many part-time workers is questionable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC trying to encourage workers with this increase is laudable, but the way they are doing it doesn’t really seem to show that they care about all of their workers,” Cavooris said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cavooris, the limitations of the plan are difficult to amend because UC Office of the President (UCOP) is directly in charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know that there are any specific union actions planned, however, we know that when people are together and working together, workers are in a better position to have more power,” Cavooris said. “So this is the best thing we can do to ensure that people get a fair wage and we have power as workers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cavooris said unionization will be critical to ensuring worker benefits for all UC employees as the plan develops further. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a totally top-down initiative on one level … it also is related to a more general climate of work connectivity across the country which includes the fight for $15 an hour in many industries,” Cavooris said. “We’re organizing ourselves to make sure we can continue to push for things like this in the future, while making sure this doesn’t just apply to a few workers again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year electrical engineering major Himangshu Chowdhury said he thinks the announcement is a step in the right direction, and he hopes more wage increases will follow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think UC has the budget to universally increase wages for every worker at the moment,” Chowdhury said. “Hopefully, as they revise their budget, student workers will see more benefits follow in the near future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the UC would rather hire more workers with fewer hours than take on the costs of an increased minimum wage for part-time employees. Perez also said the wage increase affects him as a part-time employee at Portola dining commons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students never will see the $13 hours, and on top of that students will have less to work with, so that’s the concern that I have … a lot students like myself that have to work at least 20 hours to get by,” Perez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez said if the UC aims to cut costs and students lose the freedom to increase hours, productivity and morale will decrease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Things come up for students, and they will want to have the flexibility to work more … if they can’t, they might quit, causing management to hire more people which we have to train, and thus productivity goes down in general,” Perez said. “Ultimately, I just feel the UCOP put this policy out there without thinking what it means for certain people.”</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-64716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>University of California Investment Office recently announced it divested nearly $200 million from coal mining and oil companies focused on tar sands while adding sustainability criteria to their investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC is a campaign organization comprised of students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members demanding UC divestment from all fossil fuel companies. The announcement to divest came after increased student pressure from a dozen schools following the May oil spill in Santa Barbara, preceded by three years of constant campaigning from Fossil Free UC.  Despite the partial victory, the University of California continues to invest in oil and gas industries involved in processes like the controversial method of hydraulic fracturing.</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UCSB Organizer and global studies graduate Theo LeQuesne said Fossil Free UC is a fossil fuel divestment campaign targeting the top 200 fossil fuel industries, discerned by the amount of carbon dioxide the companies release into the atmosphere. LeQuesne said divesting from the industries forces them to take responsibility for their environmental impact.</p>\n<p>“The reason we are targeting these industries is not necessarily that we think we can financially bankrupt them,” LeQuesne said. “The reason we want to do that is because they have assured themselves not to be responsible in terms of the public interest.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, fossil fuel industries lobby to block legislation targeting climate change, which motivates Fossil Free UC to continue the campaign advocating for divestment.</p>\n<p>“The fossil fuel industry has an enormous lobbying power and it’s really not okay for these people to uphold democracy and the way that politics are going at the moment,” LeQuesne said. “We will continue for divestment and we will be doing that for as long as it takes. We’re not going anywhere.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said the goal of Fossil Free UCSB is to change people’s perspective on the fossil fuel industry by educating the public on the industry’s tactics and impacts in person as well as online through social media.</p>\n<p>“We do this by having conversations with people at the arbor,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a long process, it’s one person at a time. By talking to people we encourage them to come to our meetings and get involved which is really a wonderful thing to see happening on campus.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said another goal is to reinvest the UC’s capital in more sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>“Once divestment occurs you have a lot of capitol to reinvest,” LeQuesne said. “We’re not just pushing for divestment, but putting that capitol to help benefit smaller communities and to help prevent climate change. It requires a different way of thinking of divestment.”</p>\n<p>According to LeQuesne, though the oil spill in Santa Barbara last May was damaging to the environment, it also united the UCSB community to demand the UC recognize its responsibility regarding the spill.</p>\n<p>“We had about 75 students demonstrating outside of Chancellor Yang’s office against UC investments,” LeQuesne said. “The UC has investments in Exxon mobile, for example, and Exxon Mobile’s oil was running through that pipeline that burst and endangered a whole bunch of wildlife.”</p>\n<p>LeQuesne said Fossil Free UCSB has been campaigning for three years and are excited to have won a “partial victory” through student involvement.</p>\n<p>“The recent victory is really testament that you can as a student make a difference through campaigning and activism and that is really exciting to see,” LeQuesne said. “It’s a shame that the recent divestment didn’t result in oil and gas, it was only coal and tar sands. It’s really a matter of time, I believe. It’s not an everyday occurrence.”</p>\n<p>Second-year chemistry major Isaiah Swauncy said he thinks divestment will help the shift from fossil fuels towards more sustainable alternatives.</p>\n<p>“I think fossil fuels are definitely ruining the environment,” Swauncy said. “I think it’s a great idea and stepping stone for the rest of the U.S. However, until we find another energy source that can sustain the population we can’t completely stop using fossil fuels but the UC can help with divestment.”</p>\n<p>Fossil Free UC leader and UC Berkeley creative writing major Jake Soiffer said it is about time the UC began divesting from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>“This is a hard-fought victory for students and our allies from across California who have been demanding the UC truly live up to its big talk on climate change,” Soiffer said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64731\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64731\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/uc-divests-200-million-from-big-oil/","id":2699,"author":{"id":143,"name":"Juliet Bachtel"},"related":[2698,2697,2696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Recognized for Low-Income Outreach","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"The New York Times applauds UCSB on its availability and affordability for low-income students, but some students urge that there is still much more work for the university to do","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>The <em>New York Times</em> applauds UCSB on its availability and affordability for low-income students, but some students urge that there is still much more work for the university to do</h2>\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> (NYT) recently ranked UC Santa Barbara third in the nation on its College Access Index, a system for ranking how well universities foster economic diversity and upward mobility.</p>\n<p>The Index’s top ten also includes five other UC campuses with UC Irvine at number one, UC Davis number two, UC San Diego number four, UC Los Angeles number five and UC Berkeley number seven.

This year’s results led the NYT to call UC “California’s upward mobility machine.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-eight percent of UCSB students receive Pell grants, with 31 percent also likely to graduate based on past rates, and the net cost for low and middle income students is $14,000.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), University of California Student Association (UCSA) undergraduate chair and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major Mohsin Mirza said NYT’s praise of UC as an “upward mobility machine” is “somewhat incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Students of all incomes struggle with the rising costs of housing and textbooks,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>“While the UC should be praised for the amount of financial aid it provides to low income students, particularly in comparison to other universities, that praise should be tempered with the reality that there is much work to be done.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said while the College Access Index highlights the successes of UC, UCSA will continue to be critical.</p>\n<p>“We see our role as pushing the UC to be the best it possibly can be,” Mirza said. “Praise isn’t effective at creating changes, actions and pressure are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of Admissions Lisa Przekop said she feels UCSB is “very proactive” in creating economic diversity and its high ranking in the College Access Index is a result of outreach efforts that start long before the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“We work closely with high school and community college counselors to spread the word about opportunities available at UCSB,” Przekop said in an email. “We also work with community organizations and early outreach programs to reach younger students and families as they begin to consider college preparation.”</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, one way UCSB works to serve low-income students is being “visible and available,” providing information that explains the application and financial aid processes and shows low-income families higher education is “a viable pathway to success.”</p>\n<p>“Some families don’t have a history of college attendance and fear that the cost is a barrier to even considering college,” Przekop said in an email. “We have special programs in place to meet the informational needs of first-generation and/or low-income students because they may not have easy access to that information otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Przekop said outreach and informational assistance are the only ways UC campuses increase their numbers of Pell-receiving students, because the admissions process itself is “need blind.”</p>\n<p>“Family income cannot be a deciding factor in admitting a student,” Przekop said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Przekop, the Office of Admissions promotes UCSB at over 600 high schools every fall and chooses campuses with students of all economic backgrounds, leading to greater economic diversity at the university.</p>\n<p>“These schools include those situated in low-income, middle-income, and high-income regions of the state,” Przekop said in an email. “We want students from all backgrounds because we want a diverse learning community.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major and Pell grant recipient Chance Adkins said while he was surprised UCSB is ranked third in the nation on the College Access Index, he is not surprised it was ranked highly given his experience with financial aid opportunities.</p>\n<p>“I was offered more financial aid here than anywhere else,” Adkins said. “Talking to people who attend other universities, the gap between my financial aid and theirs is higher than one would expect, especially between the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Adkins said while he is glad aid is available when needed, he believes the high number of students receiving Pell grants at UC could explain in part the recent increases in tuition and is a sign that public higher education is increasingly unaffordable without aid.</p>\n<p>“With the way that tuition keeps increasing, it makes sense that more people are needing assistance,” Adkins said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said UC should be proud of the ranking but should not let it take away from the urgency to take on “problems that still exist.”</p>\n<p>“Between unaffordable housing, students skipping meals to save money, and the majority of students in the middle class, in particular taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt, there is much work to be done,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, September 24, 2015 print edition of the<em> Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
