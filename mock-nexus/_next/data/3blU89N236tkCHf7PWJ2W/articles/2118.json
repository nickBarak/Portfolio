Letters &amp; Sciences Senators Ricardo Uribe and Xochitl Briseño, provides elected officials who fail to meet the eligibility requirements spelled out in legal code — such as an on-campus senator living off campus, as in the case of On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari — the opportunity to continue serving their terms.</p>\n<p>The elected official would have to obtain approval from both the Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) and the A.S. Executive Director, Marisela Marquez.</p>\n<p>The resolution is a modification of Standing Policy 36, which was introduced two Senate meetings ago by Uribe and Briseño. The policy would have given Senate the power to decide whether or not to grant a senator a one-time exception for their situation. The new bill also broadens the scope of the policy from senators to all elected officers.</p>\n<p>However, senators at the Feb. 20 meeting argued that because Senate is a partisan body, they would feel more comfortable if a nonpartisan body or office were in charge of granting the exception.</p>\n<p>“In terms of A.S., they [S.A.G.] are the most non-partisan,” Senator Uribe said at the Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Student Advocate is the only executive position within A.S. that is nonpartisan, as anyone running for the position must run as an independent.</p>\n<p>Aside from shifting the responsibility of reviewing an elected officer’s case to a nonpartisan body, the bill also aims to provide further clarification within the standing policy as it is.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Briseño commented on the ambiguity of A.S. legal code, noting that it is a “gray area” that causes friction amongst A.S. entities, such as when it comes to determining an elected official’s eligibility under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>This bill aims to combat legal code ambiguity problems by providing details to further clarify what factors will be included when reviewing an elected official’s eligibility.</p>\n<p>The resolution notes that “External circumstances, such as to Financial Insecurity, Physical and Mental Health, and experiencing Racism, Queerphobia, Transphobia” will be considered when reviewing the eligibility of an elected officer.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Grecia Martinez is the student sponsor on the resolution.</p>\n<p>Martinez did not respond to request for comment.</p>\n<p>The bill originates from the Senate’s one-time exception granted to Salari during the Nov. 14 Senate meeting. When the Senate granted Salari the exception, they also included a stipulation to discuss living situations, like her’s, in the A.S. Internal Affairs Committee.</p>\n<p>Judicial Council is currently hearing a case against Senator Salari regarding her living situation.</p>\n<p>The resolution noted that instances regarding an elected officer’s living arrangements have been presented in prior senates, with “no action to restructure legal code.”</p>\n<p>The resolution will reappear at next Wednesday’s senate meeting.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Feb. 21, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Max Abrams is an asst. news editor for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or maxabrams@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Although this season will only feature 48 games, it is proving to be worth the 119 day wait. The Blackhawks have earned a point in 28 straight games dating back to last season, making them tied for the second longest streak in league history. The Los Angeles Kings are playing very well recently, and Coach Darryl Sutter will have his team ready to defend Lord Stanley’s Cup. On the other side of the country, the fans in Pittsburgh are ecstatic to have Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin healthy and playing together again. These exciting storylines and record setting performances are crucial for the league to retain its integrity after an ugly offseason. Here is a review of some of the hottest teams and best players so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chicago Blackhawks</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just when it looked like the Blackhawks were finally going to lose in regulation this season, Patrick Kane netted a goal with 2:02 left in the final period of last Sunday’s game against the Red Wings. Then, Kane carried his team to a victory in an overtime shootout when he beat Detroit’s goaltender Jimmy Howard with a multiple-deke move.</p>\n<p>Kane is leading the team in goals, assists and overall points with 11, 15 and 26, respectively. If the Blackhawks continue their dominance and Kane keeps up this type of performance, he will be a strong contender for MVP.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goaltender Corey Crawford leads the league in average goals allowed with a stingy 1.41 per game. The Blackhawks also boast the best goal differential in the league at +29 and have allowed the fewest goals overall (41). Chicago plays will round out this week with two games against the Avalanche and one against the Oilers on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anaheim Ducks</p>\n<p>After missing the playoffs last season, the Ducks have played much better hockey so far this season. They are second in the entire league with 33 points and are 7-2-1 in their last ten games.</p>\n<p>They do not have a dominant offensive scorer, but they can pass the puck. Six players have eleven or more assists, and ten players have five or more goals. Captain Ryan Getzlaf leads the team in goals(8), assists(17), and overall points(25).</p>\n<p>As for the men tending the goal, Viktor Fasth is 9-1 with an average of 2.08 goals allowed per game. Also, veteran Jonas Hiller is averaging a surprisingly high 3.24 goals allowed per game. The Ducks have lost consecutive games to the Coyotes, 5-4 in shootouts. Their next three games will be at home against the Coyotes, Flames and Blues.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p>The defending Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings got off to a rough 3-7 start this season. However, Anze Kopitar and the rest of the Kings have won eight of their last ten games.</p>\n<p>Kopitar leads the team in points with 18, while fellow center Jeff Carter is first on the team and tied for second in the league with 14 goals. In the Kings 5-1 win over the Predators on Monday, Carter completed his fifth career hat trick with two goals within a 19 second span in the final period.</p>\n<p>After putting together one of the greatest post season performances ever last season, goaltender Jonathan Quick has struggled this season. He is a meager 6-6 this season and is allowing an average of 2.54 goals per game. Recently the Kings have been mixing in Jonathan Bernier between the pipes. Bernier is 5-1 this season as the goaltender and is allowing an average of 1.53 goals per game. The Kings have three more games on this homestand and then travel to play the Coyotes and Sharks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the Penguins have their superstars healthy and scoring the puck. As a team, they are second in the Eastern Conference and lead the league in average goals per game with 3.48.</p>\n<p>Sidney Crosby is leading the league in points with 36, and assists with 25. Right behind him is the Penguins left wing Chris Kunitz, who is second in the league with 28 points and first in plus-minus with 17. In addition to Kunitz and Crosby, they have seven other players with ten or more points this season. Left wing James Neal is tied for second in the league with 14 goals and Malkin is tied for fourth in the league with 18 assists.</p>\n<p>Their goaltender, Marc-Andre Fleury, is tied for the lead league in wins with 11 and is allowing an average of 2.44 goals per game. The Penguins are 7-3 in their last ten games and if their defense improves they will be a tough out in the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Montreal Canadiens</p>\n<p>The Canadiens are in first place in the Eastern Conference with 32 points. They are 7-3 in their last ten games and are allowing the fifth least amount of goals per game with 2.32.</p>\n<p>Goaltender Carey Price is tied for second in the league with 11 wins and tied for second in shutouts with two. After finishing in 28th place last season, the Canadiens have turned the page and are firing on all cylinders. In their game against the fourth place Bruins on Sunday, Montreal took advantage of the penalty on Boston’s key defender, Zdeno Chara, to take the lead for good in the third period.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ice, the Canadiens are led by left wing Max Pacioretty, and centers David Desharnais and Tomas Plekanec. They have combined for a total of 49 points this season and are distributing the puck nicely. After yesterday’s game against the Islanders, Montreal will travel to the Hurricanes, Lightning and Panthers this week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Leaders (as of March 4)</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<p>17 –

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Acacia is located across the street from Embarcadero Hall.</em> Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Their I.V. office – located across the street from Embarcadero Hall, behind Cajé Cafe on Embarcadero del Norte – is the closest long-term counseling offered for UC Santa Barbara students, providing individual therapy, group therapy and psychiatry services.</p>\n<p>Acacia was founded in 2014 by Dr. Keith Higginbotham and Dr. Brett Donnelly. The two psychologists noticed a growing demand for mental health services while working at UCSB’s Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>As a result, many students were referred to community providers to ensure consistent scheduling and shorter wait times. However, students faced several barriers to accessing these outside services, such as transportation issues, cost difficulties and provider availability.</p>\n<p>Recognizing these barriers, Higginbotham and Donnelly embraced an opportunity to create an accessible, welcoming therapy center to meet the growing needs of the student population.</p>\n<p>“We made it our mission to help students get the longer term care that they need and really address the barriers,” Higginbotham said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Acacia has been providing services to the I.V. community for upwards of five years. Today, the office works in conjunction with C.A.P.S. to ensure an effective treatment plan for each patient.</p>\n<p>Students seeking treatment first attend C.A.P.S. on campus, where they may be referred for long-term care at Acacia.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. is a really important function in doing crisis work, that short-term treatment, and a lot of the outreach and education. We want to be their premier referral service by providing the best treatment and hiring therapists who are really well-skilled in working with student issues,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>Robbyn Jackson, clinical psychologist and lead director of Acacia’s I.V. office, said he is passionate about successfully serving the needs of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“I see my role as finding the best clinicians I can to meet the needs of the student population. I’m always looking for really good quality therapists who are passionate about the work we do, and make sure that we are helping as many students as possible every week,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>The office is also home to Charlie the therapy dog, a trained therapy animal that brightens the I.V. community on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>With more than 16 therapists on staff, Higginbotham said that Acacia has a diverse pool of providers so as to make people with all identities feel welcome in their office. If a therapist at another clinic has an identity that someone is looking for, Acacia hopes to connect them through video sessions.</p>\n<p>Acacia also partners with several other organizations on campus, including C.A.R.E., the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) and the Disabled Students Program (DSP) to ensure quality mental health care to students of all identities.</p>\n<p>“We really appreciate the relationship with the university, to sort of work hand in hand with them, with referrals, understanding what the needs are that they’re seeing. We love to be able to reach out and partner with them as much as we can,” Higginbotham said.</p>\n<p>The Acacia <a href=\"https://www.acaciaroots.org/\">Resources, Outreach, and Outpatient Therapy for Students (R.O.O.T.S)</a> non-profit project is also dedicated to aiding low-income students in accessing mental health services. Students and members of the community consistently raise funds for the project, which go toward mental health education and outreach as well.</p>\n<p>The office also runs the Mental Health Advocates Internship program, in which students that are interested in the psychology field can gain hands-on experience.</p>\n<p>“We do mock therapy sessions together so they can get a feel for what it’s like to be in the field, and they do events and all kinds of stuff for us.

The Braves lead the charge with six wins and the Red Sox, Athletics, Reds, Rockies, Diamondbacks and Rangers follow close behind with five wins each.</p>\n<p>The Marlins, Padres, Pirates and the Astros are all 1-5 and sit in last place. However, it is a long season and these first couple of weeks will not solidify a team’s fate. Here is a recap of the teams and players who have lit up the diamond so far.</p>\n<p>Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis is the talk of the baseball world right now with the week that he had. All he did was hit .455 with 17 RBIs and four home runs. He set a MLB record with 16 RBIs in his team’s first four games and was also named AL Player of the Week for his efforts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The man patrolling centerfield for the Orioles hasn’t started off too bad either. His name is Adam Jones and he is an emerging superstar. He is hitting .522 (15-30) with four doubles, one home run and eight RBIs. If the Orioles are going to repeat their success in the AL East from a year ago, they will need to pitch as well as they are hitting.</p>\n<p>Down in Atlanta, the Braves and Justin Upton are flexing their muscles in the NL East. Upton is hitting .423 with eight RBIs and leads the MLB with six home runs.</p>\n<p>The Braves are also getting some great production from their young first baseman Freddie Freeman. Before a trip to the 15-day disabled list for an oblique strain, Freeman was hitting .412 with seven RBIs in only five games. After the retirement of Chipper Jones, Freeman is slowly becoming one of the faces of the franchise.</p>\n<p>Atlanta certainly has the roster to challenge the Washington Nationals from clinching a second consecutive AL East title despite solid performances from youngsters such as Bryce Harper.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to have a better week than Clayton Kershaw had. He went 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA and a minute .44 WHIP. In their first game with the game tied at zero, Kershaw blasted a home run to go along with a complete game shutout. He was named NL Player of the Week and has Dodger fans thinking about a deep playoff run.</p>\n<p>Overall, Kershaw has led a dominant Dodgers pitching staff that has allowed a mere six runs in six games, good for a 1.00 ERA, by far tops in the majors. Whether or not the rest of the lineup can support the pitching staff with run support is another question.</p>\n<p>After a disappointing season last year, the Red Sox have put that all behind them. Clay Buchholz and Jon Lester are dominating on the mound. They have combined for three wins and have allowed only three earned runs.</p>\n<p>Their young third baseman Will Middlebrooks, is turning into a star. On Sunday, Middlebrooks hit three home runs and flied out to the warning track in his final at-bat.</p>\n<p>In an AL East that has no clear cut front-runner, Boston may be able to put together enough wins for a division title despite the firesale they displayed during last season’s trade deadline. Look for these players to put up some monster seasons and hopefully avoid the injury bug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 9, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/","id":2116,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[2115,2114,2113],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
