Food Bank experienced dramatic growth at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018, which was a factor in the group’s decision to expand its service, according to A.S. Food Bank Student Coordinator Daniel Yi.</p>\n<p>“The past couple weeks we’ve been easily reaching 500 to 600 new [visitors] per day. That kind of figure is a record figure compared to last year,” Yi said. “That was the peak we were hitting last year. And the first few weeks of this quarter, we’re already at that peak.”</p>\n<p>The record increase in clients has been challenging for the Food Bank, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I have to find the balance between supplying enough food to all our clients but also work[ing] within the limitations of the actual space we have,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>“I think opening a new day and getting more supply pickups should help smooth things out and satisfy our clients’ needs.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was also able to hire more employees to make the expanded hours possible.</p>\n<p>“I currently have 11 active student staff members on my schedule to maintain the pantry and move all of the food –– a handful have been hired in the recent summer and spring quarters, and others have been around for longer,” he said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the location of the Food Bank has historically made it difficult for students to be aware of its existence and informed on its purpose.</p>\n<p>“We’re tucked away on the third floor of the UCen, so people might just not know about the food resources available to them at this campus.”</p>\n<p>Outreach by the Food Bank and its partners could be a factor in its recent growth, according to Yi.</p>\n<p>“I guess over the last year, our Food Bank committee and a lot of our partners have been doing a really good job of promoting the Food Bank and promoting our resources,” Yi said.</p>\n<p>Yi said the Food Bank has been using social media to market new developments and products.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been promoting a lot of the exciting items we’re receiving at the Food Bank, as well as special events with our partners. I think some of our developments, like our previous space expansion, new refrigerators and microwaves have also generated quite a bit of buzz for us.”</p>\n<p>The Food Bank is funded by a combination of grants and a lock-in student fee, according to Yi. Within student fees, undergraduate students pay five dollars and graduate students pay three dollars at the beginning of each quarter.</p>\n<p>“We have received grants from TGIF and Global Food Initiative in order to pay for our refrigerators and van,” Food Bank Coordinator Rodolfo Herrera said. “A.S. Finance and Business has also passed for other capital investments in our space.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Food Bank supplies most of the food to the A.S. Food Bank, Herrera said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank’s status as a non-profit allows the organization to receive special prices for assorted dry goods, low prices such as six cents per pound of bread and free produce.</p>\n<p>The Food Bank was seeing roughly 5,000 pounds of food moving in and out before opening on Fridays. With the new hours, this has increased.</p>\n<p>“With Friday open, we are now picking up food five days a week, which should bring us up to around 7,500 to 8,000 pounds per week,” Yi said.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that the A.S. Food Bank does not charge students for food, but receives their goods from the Santa Barbara County Food Bank at a discounted price, and to clarify the number of visitors they receive a day. The price of the bread has also been corrected. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

#NotWorthIt campaign warns of fines, DUI checkpoints and increased police presence during Halloween.</p>\n<p>The advertisements are targeted toward “non-locals who have no affiliation with UC Santa Barbara,” according to UCSB Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UCSB warns the public about the potential consequences of I.V. Halloween celebrations by publicizing testimonials from regretful Halloween party attendees of the past on various social media platforms, as seen in past and current advertisements.</p>\n<p>The funding for ads decreased from 2017 to 2018, according to Estrada.</p>\n<p>Halloween in 2016 and 2017 saw a significant decrease in police presence. This is part of a noticeable downward trend in the number of police in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Halloweens in 2013 and 2014 saw heavy reports of damage and arrests in I.V. as previously reported on by the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Multiple deputies will be deployed on foot this weekend to the busier streets including Del Playa Drive, Trigo Road and Sabado Tarde, according to Sergeant Daniel Calderon from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</p>\n<p>In anticipation of large crowds, both IVFP and University of California Police Department (UCPD) have increased their available staff, according to Sgt. Calderon.</p>\n<p>The safety of the UCSB’s campus was also a concern this past weekend as a result of Delirium and the soccer game against California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’re responsible for the security and safety of the campus, regardless of what’s going on. We are responsive to the crowds and the demeanor and the total activity that is going on,” IVFP Lieutenant Dave Millard said.</p>\n<p>Metal detectors were present at Delirium as part of the security screening at the request of the Thunderdome department.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) reported six citations for minor in possession, four for open container and two for loud music, according to a SBSO representative who attended the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Police issued other citations for public urination, violation of the outdoor festival ordinance and unlicensed driving. Three people were arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>A total of 27 citations and eight arrests were made on Friday and Saturday, according to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson. This number includes citations and arrests made by both SBSO and the UCPD.</p>\n<p>UCPD made five arrests on campus and issued three citations. One person was medically transported for alcohol intoxication on Friday.</p>\n<p>UCPD primarily patrolled campus property and the business district and SBSO patrolled the rest of I.V. during this past weekend, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The numbers are similar to last year, when only 25 citations and arrests were made during Halloween weekend by both departments.</p>\n<p>The post-Halloween weekend is expected to be quiet as well. The festival ordinance, preventing loud music or noise, is in effect until Nov. 4.

Each featured category will also have its own sub-section such as poetry, prose, drawings, paintings and sculptures, Woo said.</p>\n<p>“Um…” Magazine’s editorial team hopes to have print editions of their content by Winter Quarter 2019, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>While the magazine does plan on having consistent writers on their team, Woo said the majority of the content they wish to include will be submitted by students themselves, which will hopefully showcase students’ own personal struggles and stories.</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to submit content will be allowed to do so, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>“The magazine would prioritize [marginalized] people… but won’t exclude anyone who wanted to submit content,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We hope to give voices to those [marginalized] groups and opinions that don’t see as much light without feeling it necessary to censor or change what they have to say regardless of who’s listening,” the magazine’s Gofundme page states.</p>\n<p>Woo’s hope is that the magazine will turn into a community rather than just a publication. They will hold fundraisers and social events, such as open mic nights, throughout the year to get more students involved and interested.</p>\n<p>A goal for the magazine is to be able to hand out their publications for free, so more people can read their content.</p>\n<p>“I think opening up people’s eyes to new perspectives will help them practice more than just tolerance… they’ll practice acceptance and to support those who don’t fit into a very one-sided perspective,” Woo said.</p>\n<p>The magazine has its own Instagram page that will keep students updated on the progress of the publication process. They have also asked students to submit their own content, which is already being featured on the page.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-23/ucsb-students-launch-magazine-focused-on-representing-marginalized-groups/","id":2222,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2221,2220,2219],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"First-Year UCSB Student Arrested on Stalking Charges","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_9876.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_9876.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Zhang is a first-year pre-mathematical sciences major.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A 20-year-old UC Santa Barbara student was arrested on campus for stalking charges last week, according to arrest logs.</p>\n<p>University of California Police Department (UCPD) deputies arrested the student, Renzhou Zhang, at Girvetz Hall around 1:03 p.m. on Oct. 15.</p>\n<p>Zhang is a first-year pre-mathematical sciences major, according to UCSB student verification logs.</p>\n<p>He is currently living in an on-campus residence hall.</p>\n<p>He was initially booked on a $150,000 bail at the Santa Barbara Jail.
