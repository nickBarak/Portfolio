The artwork is all my concepts,“ Boogie said. „He wanted a broader perspective of exposing the truth, exposing what’s really going on out there. He comes from a background of nothing, to basically starting his own businesses out here in America, and doing a lot of interesting things politically-wise.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said people are capable of finding solutions to the political, social, economic and religious divisions present in America.</p>\n<p>“I know we’re doing it, but [people are] using money and politics to push it in a certain direction versus ‘yo man, we need to do something about that or something drastically bad is going to happen,” Boogie said. “So that can go for a lot of these topics whether it’s immigration laws, education, religion … it’s endless bro”</p>\n<p>Boogie believes that should people throughout the world overcome their differences, solutions can be created and enacted.</p>\n<p>“Of course the world, ya know, I think everybody should be on the same page, but it’s not always gonna work like that. There’s so much diversity and different perspectives. If we can just create certain solutions that mold with that diversity, we should be good, ya know? Nothing’s gonna be perfect. Let’s just use some critical thinking with a little bit of precaution. Let’s be discerning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

graduated in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>To access the large, digitally active portion of UCSB’s alumni, the university is hosting “UCSB Give Day,” its first 24-hour online donation drive on Friday, to increase donor participation in student organizations, financial aid, scholarships and faculty research.</p>\n<p>“Give Day is a 24-hour event using social media channels to digitally connect to our UCSB communities,” said Beverly Colgate, associate vice-chancellor. “It is also a concentrated outreach to our campus’ massive base of young alumni.”</p>\n<p>According to Colgate, the university has raised “matching gifts” from donors to have their dollars match another donor’s area of passion, making fundraising more “personal.” If a donor contributes at a specific time, their donation can be matched with a campus organization of their choice.</p>\n<p>“Our giving website will post the time intervals when these matching gifts are available for matching,” Colgate said. “A couple of our Gaucho celebrities gave matching gifts, too.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB,” — Beverly Colgate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UCSB First will also be tabling in front of the library on Friday to discuss the significance of philanthropy on campus. The organization will hand out T-shirts and offer photo opportunities for students to learn about the social media campaign.</p>\n<p>John Lofthus, UCSB Alumni Association associate director, said 60,000 students have graduated in the last ten years, and he hopes the young generation of alumni will digitally connect with the university, improving a nation-wide decline in percentage of alumni giving.</p>\n<p>“Young alumni are proven to be very philanthropic, but they’re wanting to invest through their philanthropy for causes they really believe in,” Lofthus said. “For us, because having alumni support is critical, it’s trying to think about how can we do a better job of connecting with our alumni. And this is one of those ways we’re hoping to do that.”</p>\n<p>An alumni group in London will be <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ucsb-gauchos-at-the-gaucho-tower-bridge-tickets-24303781264\" target=\"_blank\">hosting</a> their own Give Day at The Gaucho restaurant, showing how the event is reaching alumni “far and near,” Lofthus said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said the “community is really ready for this,” and explained that Give Day has already prompted alumni to show support for UCSB on their own social networking sites.</p>\n<p>“I cannot believe all the excitement I am seeing from our alumni, students and staff,” Colgate said in an email. “We have alumni who have volunteered to be “Digital Ambassadors” on Friday and proactively push the Give Day messaging through their social media channels.”</p>\n<p>Online fundraising is “immediate,” Colgate said, and allows donors to choose specific areas for support that they are most passionate about.</p>\n<p>“We have had an online giving site for many years, but this is the first UCSB Give Day where we focus on promoting online giving for 24 hours straight,” Colgate said in an email. “The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66219\" style=\"width: 5482px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img

by participating in Friday’s events.</p>\n<p>“UCSB First is leading the student engagement aspect of Give Day,” Frame said. “Our job is to get students excited about celebrating what an amazing feat it is that UCSB is hosting our first ever Give Day.”</p>\n<p>Frame said she hopes the online aspect of the fundraiser will create an easy way for alumni to access the university.</p>\n<p>“From a student perspective, I can predict that engaging online, whether that be via the official Give Day website, social media or word-of-mouth, will be an accessible way for students to get involved,” Frame said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said she is proud the university is using technology to support the campus in a joint effort with students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“Social media outreach is being used at many institutions, so we’re right in the middle of this wave,” Colgate said in an email. “This is a way to reach a constituency that is involved in non-traditional fundraising.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Give Day will begin on Friday at 12 a.m. Interested participants can access the website at <a href=\"https://giveday.ucsb.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://giveday.ucsb.edu</a>.</p><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Photojournalist and author Steve Winter presented <em>On the Trail of Big Cats: Tigers, Cougars, and Snow Leopards,</em> a chronicle of his work photographing wildlife throughout the world, during a lecture Sunday at UCSB’s Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>During his lecture, Winter presented videos and audio recordings varying from jungles and mountains in Asia to mountain lions living in Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“I did not choose big cats, big cats chose me,” Winter said, adding that he tries to tell the animals’ stories through his photographs.</p>\n<p>“If we save big cats, we can help save ourselves,” Winter said. “By saving the large plots of land that wide-ranging predators need to survive, we give them a home, a place to hunt, to mate and a place for the young to disperse. Conservation on such a grand scale radiates outward with global implications.”</p>\n<p>James Livingston, second-year communication major at Santa Barbara Community College, said Winter’s lecture taught him about the dangers of human involvement in natural environments, such as poachers.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know the effect that poachers really had on the environment and how they are tearing everything apart,” Livingston said. “I’m going to do more research on the places that Winter talked about because I’m interested in looking at these foreign places that don’t get much coverage.”</p>\n<p>Winter’s expedition into the wild world of cats highlighted his message that there is a global responsibility to conserve wildlife.</p>\n<p>“The forests are the lungs of the world,” Winter said. “These are the homes of the big cats, providing the air we breathe, pulling carbon from the atmosphere and slowing climate change.”</p>\n<p>“Forests protect the towns and cities around them from flooding, prevent erosion … and provide drinking water for billions of people because forests and grasslands act like sponges,” he continued. “Seventy-five percent of all water in the world comes from forests; 50 percent of the oxygen comes from forests.”</p>\n<p>First-year music and biology double major Maya Gorgas applauded Winter for linking humans and animals.</p>\n<p>“I loved Winter’s spiel on connecting animals and nature with humans and how we are both part of this network where we can both help each other,” Gorgas said.</p>\n<p>Chelsea Brandwein, third-year communication major, said Winter’s presentation of a mountain lion in front of the Hollywood sign projected an interesting contrast between urban and natural environments.</p>\n<p>“My favorite part of the lecture was when Winter presented the picture of the mountain lion with the Hollywood sign in the background because it was an incredibly moving picture that showed the juxtaposition of wildlife and the city,” Brandwein said. “It showed how close we live to wild animals and don’t realize it.”</p>\n<p>Winter urged attendees to understand the ways in which their environment is connected to those of the big cats.</p>\n<p>“I hope these stories and images help to inspire you because where there’s life, there’s hope that the time to act is now,” Winter said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
