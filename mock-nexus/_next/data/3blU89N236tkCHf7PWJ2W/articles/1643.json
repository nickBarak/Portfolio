This weekend, the Gauchos will play their final home games of the regular season, taking a break from Big West play Friday to take on Stanford before hosting UC Davis Sunday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is currently 9-3-3 overall and 3-3-1 in the Big West but has lost three of its last four games. Sitting in fourth place in the North Division with 10 points, the Gauchos need wins against conference opponents to make the postseason.</p>\n<p>“Both games are very important to us, with Sunday being a little bit more important because we know we have to win to get to the Big West playoffs,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “When we play Davis, we know we’re going to give it our all because it could be a make or break game.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB enters this weekend’s games coming off a tough overtime loss to rival Cal Poly last weekend, in which UCSB gave up a 1-0 lead late in the game.</p>\n<p>“For this weekend, we just have to forget about the loss and move on,”junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “These are two key games we have to have.”</p>\n<p>At 6-7-1 overall and 3-3-1 in the Pac-12, Stanford is a team that relies on its offense to win. The Cardinals are currently second in the Pac-12 in shots with 17.5 per game, although they only convert 1.36 goals per game. Leading the attack for Stanford is senior forward Adam Jahn with eight goals and two assists, good for second in the Pac-12. “He’s 6’3,’’ he’s active … he’s a good forward,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “He’s their go-to guy. If we want to not give up a goal, certainly keeping him from scoring will go a long way.”</p>\n<p>An offensively focused game may be exactly what UCSB needs. Struggling to score goals as of late, the Gauchos will look to take advantage of Stanford’s sub- par defense, which allows 1.43 goals per game.</p>\n<p>“This is a game for our offense. Right now, on offense, what we lack is confidence,” Baiden said. “We have to find a way to find the back of the net because that confidence will carry over to Davis and if we can get a couple early goals on Davis, [the game] will be over.”</p>\n<p>The Aggies are currently in first place in the Big West with 15 points and have won five of their last six games. They hold a 7-5-4 overall and 5-2 conference record.</p>\n<p>“The game we absolutely have to win is on Sunday,” Vom Steeg said. “We will work hard to play a number of players on Friday night because I have to have a team that’s rested enough to play on Sunday. If we win on Friday and lose Sunday, it’s a bad weekend.”</p>\n<p>At Davis almost two weeks ago, the Gauchos lost 1-0. The Aggies were able to hold UCSB offensively and eventually found a goal in the 85th minute on a free kick.</p>\n<p>Each team only took nine shots, which is about eight shots below UCSB’s average of 17.2. Davis also outshot UCSB 4-3 in shots on goal in an offensive struggle for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to attack Davis,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to take 25 shots. I even told the guys I’d like the goal to be 30 shots. We have to be able to get goals.”</p>\n<p>While Sunday’s game will feature the two best defenses in conference, with Santa Barbara ranking first in the Big West in goals against average at .82 and Davis ranking second at .95, scoring goals will be the ultimate priority for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a position where we have to take chances, take risks, be aggressive and do everything we can to find the back of the net,” Vom Steeg said. “That exposes you a little bit and you might give something in the back, but we have no choice.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday’s game against Stanford is set for 7 p.m. while Sunday’s game against Davis will start at 2 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

With Thursday night’s venue set to be Harder Stadium, it’s also worth noting that the Blue and Gold hold a home record of 7-3-1 on the season. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the Golden Bears, Cal’s season hasn’t gone quite as well as they had wanted. Early on in the regular season, they were a “receiving votes” side according to the national rankings. Since then, their form has dipped some, and the team has struggled to consistently find wins; they now stand at an overall record of 8-6-3. Nevertheless, they’ll be coming off an impressive 1-0 win over previously No. 4 Stanford and will be hungry for a second opportunity to face UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal is favored historically here, with the Gauchos trailing in the all-time series by a record of 11-19-3. This is also reflected in the earlier outing between the two sides back in September, when the Golden Bears defeated the Gauchos by a score of 3-0. Much will be on the line come game time, but UCSB will have an added incentive in that the last time they beat Cal was way back in 2003 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a win here will end that drought and propel them into Sunday’s second round of the NCAA Tournament. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players to watch for among the Gauchos will be those who weren’t present in the last encounter due to international duty and ineligibility but who will surely make their presence known on the field this week. First up is Big West Defensive Player of the Year and senior defender Noah Billingsley. Originally unable to play because of a call-up by his home country of New Zealand, Billingsley plays the stalwart role on the Gaucho defense; with 5 assists to his name, he’ll act as an imposing force against the Golden Bear attackers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, the Big West Freshman of th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e Year, forward Finn Ballard McBride. With a team-leading 9 goals to his name, as well as a pair of assists, McBride is an ever-present danger to opposing defenders whenever he gets the minutes he deserves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior defender Hunter Ashworth (New Zealand call-up) and senior defender Faouzi Taieb (previously injured) will also be available this time around. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Cal’s end, their forward duo, sophomore Alonzo Del Mundo and junior Tommy Williamson, will be providing the goal threat. Del Mundo leads his side in playmaking with 9 assists, as well as 2 goals of his own. Meanwhile, Williamson is Cal’s top scorer with 9 goals total on the season; it was Williamson’s penalty-kick goal that earned the Golden Bears the 1-0 upset over Stanford. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altogether, it’s a make-or-break game for both teams this Thursday, as the NCAA Tournament is formatted as single elimination. The winner advances to the second round’s opponent — Saint Mary’s College — while the loser will see their season come to a close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the postseason action kicks off this Thursday, Nov. 21, as UCSB hosts Cal in Harder Stadium at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/no-22-ucsb-hosts-cal-in-opening-round-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/no-22-ucsb-hosts-cal-in-opening-round-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/no-22-ucsb-hosts-cal-in-opening-round-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/no-22-ucsb-hosts-cal-in-opening-round-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/no-22-ucsb-hosts-cal-in-opening-round-of-ncaa-tournament/","id":1642,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1641,1640,1639],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rivalry Renewed: UCSB and Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/01-10-19-12-NEWS-11111.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/01-10-19-12-NEWS-11111.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"In tonight’s blue-green rivalry game against Cal Poly, pride won’t be the only thing on the line.

That’s the mentality we have right now.”</p>\n<p>Both teams came up with big wins Tuesday to keep the league standings close. The Mustangs defeated UC Davis, while Santa Barbara handed Big West leader Sacramento State its first conference loss. In UCSB’s 2-0 victory, the Gauchos finally found their offensive rhythm, scoring two goals in the first 10 minutes of play and breaking a two-game scoring drought.</p>\n<p>“I think our outside guys, like Ema, were busy early,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said. “We got them the ball early and we got good service. We were lucky to get on the end of a couple and get ahead early, which we haven’t done in a while.” With a lack of scoring in the past, UCSB has switched formations, moving into a 4-2-3-1, which gives the outside backs freedom to push forward and get into the attack. That allows Santa Barbara to use one of its big offensive weapons in freshman defender Ema Boateng, who ranks third on the team in scoring with four goals.</p>\n<p>“A couple ways of scoring when you face nine to 10 guys (playing defense), [which] is what we see in every game, is to pass really well and get around the corners,” Vom Steeg said. “So, we made an effort to get Ema the ball and we’ll stay after that.”</p>\n<p>Allowing the Gauchos to switch into the more offensively minded line-up has been the return of senior midfielder Machael David. In David’s first game back from injury Tuesday, David assisted the first goal. Combined with Baiden, the two create a strong holding midfield, allowing more players to push up. “[David] provides a lot of the energy and he’s an emotional leader,” Vom Steeg said. “He does a lot of the running, which allows us to win the midfield and move forward. He’s a key piece to our ability to win games and move forward.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB ranks second in league in shots and goals, averaging 16.71 and 1.93 per game, respectively, this game may come down to defense and who scores first. The Gauchos concede just .79 goals per game, second in the Big West, while the Mustangs are right behind, allowing one goal per game.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’ll be a high scoring game, so I think that the team that scores first [will win],” Vom Steeg said. “For us, the key is to get a goal in that first half, even if [that means going] in 1-1 at halftime. We feel if we get two balls in every game, with the way we defend, we will win every game.”</p>\n<p>Leading the attack for the Gauchos all season has been Ryan, who ranks third in the league in points with seven goals and one assist.</p>\n<p>“I think Nic Ryan is stepping up like Luis Silva did for us last year,” Baiden said. “He’s a very creative player and very intelligent. We have to make sure he’s up the field more and not coming back to play defense.”</p>\n<p>On the other side for Cal Poly is junior forward McKenzie Pridham, who ranks second in the Big West in points with eight goals and is second is goals per game with a .57 average.</p>\n<p>“[Pridham] plays a position that is a really good match-up for us,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s [their] point forward and we have two really good centerbacks and in Welsh and Brockway. We will have two strong, physical defenders on him.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against rival Cal Poly is set for 8 p.m. The game will also be broadcast live on Fox Soccer Channel.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48292\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48292\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-19/rivalry-renewed-ucsb-cal-poly/","id":1640,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1639,1638,1637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Erupt to Beat CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Coming off its first conference win of the season last weekend, the UCSB women’s soccer team went on the road still in contention for qualifying for the Big West Tournament.

With only seven points earned and one game left in the year, the Gauchos will be left on the outside looking in as only the top four teams in the league will compete for the Big West title.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After an impressive offensive output against Fullerton, the Gauchos struggled finding the back of the net Sunday against Riverside. UCR took an early lead, scoring in the third minute on junior midfielder Andrea Morales’ shot from a set piece.</p>\n<p>The goal seemed to settle down the Gauchos, who then took control of the game for the entire duration of the match, even forcing a penalty kick, which was blocked by the Highlander goalkeeper. Despite outplaying UCR in every aspect, the Gauchos could not finish their opportunities.</p>\n<p>“We took more shots, we took more corner kicks, we even earned ourselves a penalty kick, but we just did not finish our chances,” Stumpf said. “I think the girls are a little disappointed in themselves because I think we let one slip away.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s game, the Gauchos faced a Fullerton team that had only allowed four total goals in conference entering the match. However, UCSB capitalized on its only three shots in the first half, scoring the trio of goals in a 15 minute span.</p>\n<p>Sophomore midfielder/forward Indiana Mead opened the scoring for the Gauchos in the 15th minute, followed by freshman midfielder/forward Angelisa Cortez’s third goal of the season a minute later. After the Titans cut the lead in half, senior midfielder Erin Ortega scored to send the Gauchos into halftime with a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton came out of halftime pressuring the UCSB backline, outshooting the Gauchos 12-6 in the second half, but junior goalkeeper Makenna Henry was the defensive stopper of the game, coming up big with nine saves on the night. Freshman forward/midfielder Mayra Almazan sealed UCSB’s first road conference win of the season with her first collegiate goal in the 70th minute.</p>\n<p>“The shooting Friday night was significantly better and interestingly enough we played a better team on Friday and we snuck four [goals] in,” Stumpf said. “Friday night was a great performance for our team. Once again they played hard; the possession was really nice.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s four goals were the most allowed this season by the Titans, who came in as one of the top-ranked defenses in the Big West. These four goals were also the most scored this season by the Gauchos, who came in struggling and won only their second game in the last nine matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now prepare itself for the Blue-Green rivalry game against Cal Poly this Sunday at San Luis Obispo in its final match of the season.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/","id":1641,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1640,1639,1638],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
