Senate has approved two bills to ensure a timely investigation into bribery allegations made against the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) during the A.S. Spring Election.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Elections Board called for a “re-vote” of the entire spring election ballot in April, alleging that the IFC “bribed” students to vote by awarding “philanthropy grants” to chapters with the highest voter turnout.</p>\n<p>In an opinion piece <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/statement-from-inter-fraternity-council-president-regarding-allegations-of-bribery-in-a-s-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">published in the <em>Nexus</em></a>, IFC President Brendan Gonzalez said IFC consulted with the Office of Student Life prior to developing the grant program.</p>\n<p>Since these claims were made, the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department has been leading an investigation into possible irregularities in the voting process.</p>\n<p>The senate first approved a resolution to extend senators’ terms into Week Nine of Spring Quarter in case the investigatory report is released shortly before summer.</p>\n<p>The senators-elect are usually sworn in during the week eight Senate meeting; however, according to current A.S President Jimmy Villarreal, this resolution will “push everything back” and give the current Senate more time to deliberate on the results if they should come in before the year ends.</p>\n<p>Robert Tarsia, director of the Audit and Advisory Services, said the department hopes the investigation will be completed by the end of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“We’ve devoted resources to doing our best,” said Tarsia. “That always depends on the availability of the people we speak with, but we’re having pretty good success.”</p>\n<p>Senate also approved the formation of the “Villarreal Election Commission,” named after President Villarreal. The commission will consider the final investigatory report if the investigation continues into summer.</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he hopes to appoint 10 members to the commission, seven to vote and three to act as ex-officio members. These appointed commissioners will be chosen from the judicial, legislative and executive branches of A.S. and must be nonpartisan.</p>\n<p>According to the proposals, there is “no known timeline” for investigating the bribery allegations against IFC, making the precautionary resolutions important in completing a full investigation.</p>\n<p>“We don’t know when this investigation is going to end,” Villarreal said. “Whenever that investigation and report comes out … someone needs to receive it.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal proposed both resolutions at last week’s Senate meeting and submitted a co-authored letter with President-elect Austin Hechler further detailing the resolutions and each of their commitments to A.S.</p>\n<p>“We just don’t have any guarantee that anyone is going to be around to make those decisions,” Villarreal added.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to find as many people who are as removed from this election as possible, whether that means they were helping out, they were endorsing [or] they were actively running,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>While A.S. Attorney General Brandon Lee is also investigating the alleged bribery, Tarsia said the Audit and Advisory Department’s investigation is not connected to Lee’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty standard to make sure that you touch base with anyone else who’s doing a parallel investigation,” Tarsia said. “But we’re not in any way coordinating our efforts or sharing information.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal will continue to release weekly updates on the investigation progress and conclusion.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71158\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/bills-approved-for-timely-bribery-investigation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71158\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/bills-approved-for-timely-bribery-investigation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/bills-approved-for-timely-bribery-investigation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/bills-approved-for-timely-bribery-investigation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-19/bills-approved-for-timely-bribery-investigation/","id":2480,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2479,2478,2477],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCen Dining To Begin Using Cage-Free Eggs Menu","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/factoryfarm_-sierra-deak.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/factoryfarm_-sierra-deak.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCen Dining catering services will begin a transition to cruelty-free animal products next week by introducing cage-free eggs into their new menu.

CAS slowly drains the oxygen from the birds’ confinement to make their death less stressful before the slaughtering operation.</p>\n<p>“It’s cage-free, but it’s a little bit more than cage-free,” Lazarus said. “There’s a bunch of different types of certifications … People go to inspect how the hens are being treated as they’re being raised.”</p>\n<p>The move away from factory farms will create higher costs for purchasing food, but Lazarus hopes to convince students and faculty that “it’s an investment worth making” that will lead to better living conditions for farm animals.</p>\n<p>“Catering has the ability to absorb prices a little better than the retail units, so we’re really sensitive to not raising prices on a bowl of soup at Coral Tree Café or a sandwich at the Arbor because we know that students are already stretching their money as far as they possibly can,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>According to Andrew deCoriolis, Farm Forward’s director of strategic programs and engagement, reducing portion sizes will lower the costs of higher quality food and the transition to a more sustainable, vegetarian meal plan can result in less expensive animal products while also ensuring animals lived a decent life before dying.</p>\n<p>The total cost comparison between factory farms and cage-free farms is unavailable at this time and will be released in the fall.</p>\n<p>Lazarus said that the project was inspired by a variety of concerns, including the environmental impact and health concerns that arise from eating too much meat.</p>\n<p>“When you have a bunch of hens raised in a factory farm, it’s incredibly efficient but it also concentrates waste and concentrates byproducts and they’re not allowed to permeate through the soil in a natural way,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>However, he said the biggest motivation for the project is a “moral obligation” to decrease animal cruelty in the meat and dairy industry.</p>\n<p>“It’s not really directly connected to sustainability and nutrition, it’s more about how … we treat animals, and, to me, those are morally equivalent,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>A California law passed in January 2015 required an increase in space allocation for factory farm chickens. Another law, AB-1437, banned the selling of eggs from chickens raised in small, wire “battery” cages with limited space.</p>\n<p>However, Farm Forward and UCen Dining are still concerned with the animals’ living conditions in the factory farm industry, as many factories do not give birds outdoor access, and some slaughter their animals by hanging them upside down and electrocuting them.</p>\n<p>According to deCoriolis, over 90 percent of American poultry is raised on factory farms.</p>\n<p>“[The program is] led because students and employees are saying [that] ‘we want better products, we want more plants, we want fewer animals,’” deCoriolis said. “‘And if we are going to eat animals, we want to eat animals that are raised in really great ways.’”</p>\n<p>DeCoriolis said he believes that the move from factory farms will be possible at UCSB due to its reputation as a sustainable and environmentally aware campus.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been working with … several of the UCs to help them look at their supply chain and look at the kind of products that they buy and serve and help them understand what those products really look like and understand whether or not those products align with their institutional values,” deCoriolis said.</p>\n<p>Audrey Horn, second-year biopsychology major, has been working with Lazarus and deCoriolis to implement the changes into the UCen catering services. She became involved with the program after learning about the ways factory farm animals were raised and slaughtered.</p>\n<p>Horn said she hopes more students realize the harmful ways animals are being handled on factory farms and plans to connect with movements at other universities for improved farm animal treatment.</p>\n<p>“Students have a serious impact, but we don’t realize it,” Horn said. “Everything we’re doing, and everything that’s going on, so much more can happen if more students knew about it. Changes will happen at UCSB if the students want changes to happen.”</p>\n<p>Horn said the push for cruelty-free farms will not stop with cage-free eggs.</p>\n<p>“Cage-free is a step, which is really exciting, but that’s not the final goal,” Horn said. “The final goal is to be certified humane … the best of the best quality.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A bright mustard yellow, this one-story structure houses the elusive College of Creative Studies (CCS).</p>\n<p>With about 350 students in the entire college, CCS reflects a very small but unique percentage of UCSB undergraduates.</p>\n<p>Though one of only three colleges here at UCSB, CCS is the most abstract in terms of research and academics. Students within this program only need eight general education (GE) requirements for their major, can drop a class up until the day before a final and do not receive grades for classes taken within the College of Creative Studies.</p>\n<p>CCS students typically enroll in both CCS and College of Letters &amp; Sciences (L&amp;S) courses each quarter, but Ezra Kosviner, first-year chemistry/biochemistry CCS major, said he appreciates the more relaxed feel of a CCS class.</p>\n<p>“Because you know you’re not taking it for a grade, you’re generally interested in the class,” Kosviner said. “There’s no great benefit to you other than to learn.”</p>\n<p>Students are awarded units based on their academic performance, ranging from zero to six units depending on the quality of their assignments, participation and attendance.</p>\n<p>Although CCS students rely on L&amp;S courses to create their GPA, CCS is a rigorous and research-oriented program. Tengiz Bibilashvili, professor and advisor for the CCS physics major, explains that the introductory class for physics contains multiple elements of upper-division classes.</p>\n<p>He adds that many juniors take graduate-level classes and start research during their freshman and sophomore years.</p>\n<p>“CCS classes go much deeper, are more in-depth,” Bibilashvili said. To stay and succeed in the CCS physics program, Bibilashvili said students must be “sick with physics.”</p>\n<p>“They must be people who love science, who love physics, who just don’t count the time they spend solving problems,” he said.</p>\n<p>Talon Stark, second-year CCS mathematics major, agrees.</p>\n<p>“More than anything, it lets you dedicate all of your time on your own discipline,” Stark said.</p>\n<p>Some CCS students say they encounter misconceptions of elitism, competitiveness and lack of structure regarding CCS among their peers. Emma Horanic, first-year CCS biology major, said she worries that CCS students are assumed to have an easier route to academic success.</p>\n<p>Horanic noted that although CCS students have more opportunities for individual attention, they are not handed connections for research and projects.</p>\n<p>“You have to put in the effort to make that connection; advisors don’t automatically do it for you,” Horanic said.</p>\n<p>Anoop Praturu, first-year CCS physics major, said the CCS program is more collaborative than competitive.</p>\n<p>“There’s no shame in going to someone and saying, ‘Yo, I don’t get this shit, can you help me out?’” Praturu said. “There’s no shame in asking for help.”</p>\n<p>While the CCS students have much more freedom in choosing classes tailored specifically to their interests, they also have additional guidance in planning schedules and identifying career goals. Each student is assigned an advisor who is also a researcher or professor in their area of interest.</p>\n<p>Gabby Najm, second-year CCS biology major, is graduating at the end of next year and seeks to pursue fieldwork. Najm said she feels very supported in this program by professors.</p>\n<p>“They just want you to succeed to the best of your ability, and they know you have it in you to do well,” Najm said.</p>\n<p>In terms of academic preparation, Bibilashvili said that, for undergraduates, research depends more on one’s skillset rather than on one’s college enrollment.</p>\n<p>“Professors don’t care what label is on your jacket, CCS or [Letters &amp; Science]. It doesn’t matter,” Bibilashvili said. “If you are prepared in research, they will take you.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-find-a-home-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/","id":2478,"author":{"id":111,"name":"Annie Golay"},"related":[2477,2476,2475],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
