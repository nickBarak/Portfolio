Cupp explained her transition from a liberal in college to a conservative later in life, articulated her positions on everything from trigger warnings to feminism and finally held a Q&amp;A session.</p>\n<p>Cupp said her preconceived notions of Republicans and the prevailing negative stereotypes associated with the party did not match her personal experiences.</p>\n<p>“Republicans, I had learned from popular culture, were greedy, racist, sexist, dumb, warmongers, crooks and liars,” Cupp said. “This was before George W. Bush even came along — and I of course was none of those things.”</p>\n<p>Cupp said the incident in which feminist studies Professor Miller-Young attacked a pro-life 16-year-old demonstrator last year indicated that liberal progressives did not support the principles of free speech.</p>\n<p>“When college professors of all people think it’s appropriate education to steal and tear up the sign of a peaceful protestor, regardless of what they are protesting, you know that progressives have totally abandoned their one-time commitment to free speech,” Cupp said.</p>\n<p>Cupp said she felt the effort by UCSB students to provide trigger-warnings to students for graphic content pertaining to sexual assault and extreme violence was “insane” and unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“It only sounds somewhat legitimate because you’re living in it, but to anyone in the real world that’s insane,” Cupp said. “I mean there’s no threat that you’re going to cause me to cause myself physical harm … with something you say. The fact that people buy this is crazy.”</p>\n<p>Cupp said American society has developed with the primary goal of not offending any individual.</p>\n<p>“We have become a society that aims to offend exactly, precisely, no one,” Cupp said. “If one person is offended it’s too much. That’s crazy.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jason Garshfield said he supported every point made by Cupp, but that he would have preferred a larger audience at the event.</p>\n<p>“I think she’s on to something big and I agree with everything she said,” Garshfield said. “I do think it’s somewhat limited in the fact that everyone here from the Republicans is aware of the problems she’s talking about and what we need to do is not just come together and talk about them, but to come together and find solutions to them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Alice Gilbert said the event’s purpose was to remind students of the importance of universities as bastions of free expression.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for students to remember that the university setting is possibly the freest place of thought that exists,” Gilbert said.</p>\n<p>Local resident James Barton said he appreciated an opportunity to listen to a different political perspective.</p>\n<p>“I think she was here to share her opinion of freedom of speech and deliver her point of view. Maybe it wasn’t what we all agree on, but it was nice to hear it,” Barton said. “Working at such a liberal outlet where she works, it’s great to hear.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63258\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/cupp-discusses-freedom-of-speech/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63258\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/cupp-discusses-freedom-of-speech/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/cupp-discusses-freedom-of-speech/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/cupp-discusses-freedom-of-speech/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/cupp-discusses-freedom-of-speech/","id":2784,"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson"},"related":[2783,2782,2781],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":164,"name":"David Jackson","biography":"Not available","articles":[2784,2815,2930,3003,3007,3009,3016,3018,3024,3041,3046,3052,3062,3064,3065,3124,3138,3493,3622,5935],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Student Campaign Targets Mental Health Stigma","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Six undergraduate students began a quarter-long campaign this week titled “Destigmatize Counseling” to combat negative stigmas surrounding mental illness by posting positive messages on social med...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Six undergraduate students began a quarter-long campaign this week titled “Destigmatize Counseling” to combat negative stigmas surrounding mental illness by posting positive messages on social media outlets to encourage people to seek professional help if needed.</p>\n<p>The idea for the campaign was first proposed in the students’ Education 173 leadership development class. As part of their campaign, the students are collecting pictures, inspirational quotes and personal stories from UCSB students and sharing them on their website and Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and fourth-year theater major Fangyuan Liu said the group plans to combine a strong social media presence with an on-campus campaign to spread the message.</p>\n<p>“We are going to share their [the students’] stories and quotes on Facebook, make their quotes into flyers and distribute them to different departments and boards on campus,” Liu said in an email. “Also, we are going make a big presentation board and we are going to present it on the lawn by Pardall tunnel.”</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and fourth-year psychology major Yasmin Irfani said sharing students’ stories on social media allows more people to see them.</p>\n<p>“Our main idea is the website and Facebook page because that’s what most students look at,” Irfani said. “They can see people’s stories and think, ‘Oh, I’ve seen this person on campus I didn’t know they felt this way.’”</p>\n<p>According to Irfani, the campaign is meant to send positive messages to students who are discouraged from visiting Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and other resources aimed to help those with mental illness.</p>\n<p>“This is what we wanted to do because we believe that every student should feel comfortable walking into CAPS knowing that it’s OK to feel however they’re feeling. We wanted to help them feel validated,” Irfani said.</p>\n<p>Liu said stigmas surrounding mental illness are problematic because they prevent students from seeking counseling and she hopes the campaign changes people’s attitudes to “normalizing instead of stigmatizing.”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes people may not want to share their troubles with loved ones, perhaps in the fear of being a burden on them,” Liu said in an email. “Talking to a professional psychologist can give a person a different perspective and counselors are able to offer people non-judgmental and professional help to guide them through their difficult times.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major and campaign participant Suman Sidhu said she is in support of the project because it will allow students to feel more comfortable reaching out for help.</p>\n<p>“People refuse to view mental health as something that needs to be prioritized, especially on college campuses where so many students struggle with such things,” Sidhu said in an email. “I love this project because it approves that none of us is alone when it comes to having struggles, it is very easy to look around and think you are the only one going through difficult times.”</p>\n<p>Sidhu said she sought out counseling for her anxiety but wished she could have been more informed about mental health resources sooner.</p>\n<p>“Personally I struggle with anxiety and have found CAPS to be extremely helpful,” Sidhu said in an email. “I was one of those people that felt skeptical about counseling and therapy, but I wish I had been educated about it way earlier in life. Everyone should feel comfortable walking into that pink building and asking for help.”</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and second-year philosophy major Brianna Taylor said she is pleased with the number of online submissions since she expected a low turnout due to the strong negative stigma surrounding mental illness.</p>\n<p>“I guess I thought the stigma around this topic was so high that I anticipated a lower turn-out, but it’s great to see the reality of the situation,” Taylor said in an email “I hope we are making a difference by putting a local, friendly face next to optimism and words about normalizing mental health.”</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and fourth-year psychology major Juan Salinas said due to the unexpected success of the project, the campaign may continue beyond this quarter.</p>\n<p>“As far as the course assignment goes, once the quarter is over it’s over and we don’t have to do anything with it,” said Salinas, “But we think it actually has potential to continue on, so we’re going to build it up as much as we can until then, and offer it up to anyone willing to continue it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63259\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/student-campaign-targets-mental-health-stigma/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63259\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/student-campaign-targets-mental-health-stigma/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/student-campaign-targets-mental-health-stigma/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/student-campaign-targets-mental-health-stigma/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/student-campaign-targets-mental-health-stigma/","id":2782,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[2781,2780,2779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Talks Calculators, Bikes, Library Expansion","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Senate-May-6_Hari-Patel-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Senate-May-6_Hari-Patel-2.jpg?resize=600%2C401&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Senate met to review funding options for several campus projects Wednesday night in the Flying A room of the UCen.

Tech Rental, A.S. Bike Committee projects and possible contributions to the Davidson Library expansion and renovation.</p>\n<p>A.S. controller and fourth-year electrical engineering major Amir Khazaieli spoke to Senate about a proposed program to expand A.S.’s current i&gt;Clicker rental service into “A.S. Tech Rental,” which will loan students equipment such as calculators and phone and laptop chargers.</p>\n<p>“The i&gt;Clicker rental program pilot gave us much insight on this type of project,” Khazaieli said. “For Spring Quarter 2015, forty i&gt;Clickers were loaned out.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said A.S. Tech Rental will have a website to help students understand the program.</p>\n<p>“[It] will have all the listed items with a picture of the item next to it, the loan time limit, the loan price, the liability price, and if the item is currently in stock and available,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said the estimated prices for 24-hour rental start at $1 for scientific calculators and $5 for graphing calculators. Phone and laptop chargers will be free for four-hour periods. Depending on the item rented, rental periods will range between four hours to one full quarter.</p>\n<p>The estimated start-up cost of A.S. Tech Rental Program is $586.60 and A.S. is looking into reducing costs by purchasing used items from students, according to Khazaieli.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the things we would be looking to do with a grant potentially is to create traffic lights on Pardall that would be at the Embarcadero intersections to make them a lot safer and also just to slow down traffic. – A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Patrick “Mac” Kennedy</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair and third-year history major Patrick “Mac” Kennedy updated Senate on the Committee’s plans for fall quarter.</p>\n<p>Kennedy said the Bike Committee is pursuing outside funding for projects, such as installing traffic lights on Pardall Rd.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we would be looking to do with a grant potentially is to create traffic lights on Pardall that would be at the Embarcadero intersections to make them a lot safer and also just to slow down traffic,” Kennedy said. “There are a lot of bad accidents there.”</p>\n<p>According to Kennedy, a second A.S. bike shop is under construction at the San Joaquin Apartments to better serve those living in off-campus, university-owned housing.</p>\n<p>“There’s already like 2,000 students who don’t have access to the bike shop,” Kennedy said. “There’s about to be 2,000 more with Sierra Madre and San Joaquin.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy also said the Committee wants to repave the bike path near Girvetz Hall and expand bike parking near the Life Sciences Building, Humanities and Social Sciences Building and Harold Frank Hall.</p>\n<p>Third-year biochemistry major Leah Johnson requested the Senate’s approval to receive $900 from Community Affairs Board (CAB) to cater a dinner sponsored by Camp Kesem, an organization that raises money for children of parents diagnosed with cancer.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year history of public policy major Cassandra Mancini said Senate should honor CAB’s decision and approve the funding for Camp Kasem.</p>\n<p>“This is their first year on campus,” Mancini said. “CAB wanted to support them. CAB made the decision to fund them because they thought the organization and event was important. I think we should respect CAB’s decision and grant them the funds.”</p>\n<p>College of Engineering Collegiate Senator and fourth-year mechanical engineering major Jonathan Rothchild said the Camp Kesem should receive funding from CAB because of their initiative in seeking sponsorship.</p>\n<p>“They go out and actively seek sponsorship,” Rothschild said. “They’re a very strong organization. I support their cause wholeheartedly.”</p>\n<p>Senate approved the CAB’s funding Camp Kesem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some of the things that were brought up included … outfitting all UCPD police with body cams. – A.S. President Ali Guthy</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy, who spoke with UC President Janet Napolitano at the Council of Presidents last week, said she and Napolitano talked about addressing police misconduct.</p>\n<p>“Some of the things that were brought up included … outfitting all UCPD police with body cams,” Guthy said. “The President promised to do some research on the cost of that, as well as talking about mental health services.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, Napolitano will increase the student services fee to fund mental health programs.</p>\n<p>“She plans to increase the student services fee and have 50 percent of those funds allocated to mental health,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Senate gave Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus $950 to print 2,500 copies of the new Financial Resource Guide on recycled paper.</p>\n<p>College of Letters and Science Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Jimmy Villarreal said no unallocated funds are left.</p>\n<p>“We’ve exhausted our senate unallocated funds,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>New senate unallocated funds will be available when the new fiscal year begins in July.</p>\n<p>After approving the 2015-’16 budget, Senate had a $17,794.74 balance to reallocate.

CFO Andre Theus (right), listen to funding requests from campus organizations Monday evening. <em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associate Students Finance and Business Committee met Monday in the UCen’s State Street Room to hear funding requests from five campus organizations, two of which it granted.</p>\n<p>The committee heard requests with approximately $4,000 allocated for Culture Weeks and Graduation and no further funding available, according to Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year sociology major Andre Theus. Pilipino Graduation (P-Grad), Hermanas Unidas, the University Center (UCen) and the Persian Student Group all requested funding, and Black Graduation (Black Grad) requested reallocation of previously granted funds. The committee granted P-Grad and Black Grad’s requests.</p>\n<p>Black Grad representative Jasmine Moses requested the $3,250 the committee previously granted the organization to fund a keynote speaker be reallocated for degree covers, paper to print certificates, flowers, a cake, UCen catering services, use of Campbell hall, a balloon arch and cocktail tables.</p>\n<p>According to Moses, the organization had to request reallocation because university policy prohibits private groups from paying faculty members to speak at graduation events.</p>\n<p>“Our speaker is a faculty member, hence we can’t pay a faculty member to speak at graduation,” Moses said.</p>\n<p>The committee reallocated $2,300 of Black Grad’s funding and suggested the group request further reallocations at a later meeting.</p>\n<p>P-Grad requested $2,570 to fund a dinner for 23 graduates and their guests, a speaker and transportation for the organization’s graduation event.</p>\n<p>A P-Grad representative said the organization has been fundraising, but would like help from the committee.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of fundraisers this quarter,” the representative said. “We had one last week and we have two more, so we are trying to fund programs ourselves, so it would just be a big help.”<br>\nThe committee granted P-Grad’s request.</p>\n<p>The UCen requested $700 to fund labor for UStudy Center, the UCen’s extended hours and services during dead week and finals week.</p>\n<p>According to a UCen representative, the UStudy center needs a service manager and service assistant on shift earning $10 per hour from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. to oversee special services throughout the UCen property, such as review sessions and free massages.</p>\n<p>“In order to be able to do this for our students, we need to be able to have our staff here at that time,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>The committee denied the UCen’s request.</p>\n<p>Hermanas Unidas representative Julia Ostromogilskaya requested $1,042 to purchase catering service for an estimated 70 to 100 people, furniture, a piñata and other supplies for the organization’s annual “Carne Asada con La Raza” cultural event.</p>\n<p>Ostromogilskaya said the event would include discussion on cultural appropriation surrounding Cinco de Mayo, even though the holiday has passed.</p>\n<p>“It’s usually a little closer to Cinco de Mayo,” Ostromogilskaya said. “This year since it’s after we’re still going to reference it and talk about Cinco de Mayo and its actual history and cultural appropriation and what that is and how people within the community feel about it.”</p>\n<p>Financial officer and second-year political science major Izzy Ninh said the $500 the organization budgeted for food was excessive.</p>\n<p>“I would love for us to make that happen; however, I think spending $500 on food for 70 people is a lot,” Ninh said.</p>\n<p>The committee denied Hermanas Unidas’ request.</p>\n<p>Persian Student Group representative and third-year psychology major Leilani Riahi requested $1,000 to fund a catered dinner for an estimated 200 people after the group’s annual Persian Cultural Show this Thursday at the MultiCultural Center Theater.</p>\n<p>Riahi said the organization would plan an alternative gathering if it cannot fund a catered dinner.</p>\n<p>“We usually do dinner, but if we don’t get the money we could always do Persian sweets and tea,” Riahi said.</p>\n<p>Financial officer Austin Kang said the committee should not fund the group out of funds allocated for Culture Weeks and Graduation because they are not planning an event as part of a culture week.</p>\n<p>“If it’s not part of a weeklong event or if it’s just like a one-day celebration, it shouldn’t come out of Culture and Grad,” Kang said. “I looked at the Legal Code, and it said it was for cultural, weeklong events.”</p>\n<p>The committee denied Persian Culture Group’s request.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
