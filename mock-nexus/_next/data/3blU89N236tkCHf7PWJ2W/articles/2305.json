To view them just on a basis of names, it would seem as though player value begins to drop off around the 10th spot on each list. But if you look carefully, you will find low-ranked players who still produce solid numbers and may even still be available in your league.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at ESPN’s rankings. On its list of the top quarterbacks, ESPN has Matt Schaub of the Houston Texans ranked 6th, while Chad Henne of the Miami Dolphins is ranked 14 spots lower at #20. Schaub has almost 200 more yards passing than Henne, has a higher QB rating, and has thrown for two more touchdowns, making it seem as though Schaub is the obvious choice over Henne. But to be a successful fantasy owner, you are going to need to look a bit deeper. Take Henne and Schaub. Despite his numbers, Schaub has only scored nine more fantasy points than Henne. Why? Interceptions. Schaub has thrown four interceptions to Henne’s one. </p>\n<p>So while Schaub has had the more explosive season, he is also more likely to hurt you fantasy-wise. And while Schaub is owned in 100 percent of ESPN leagues, Henne is still available in almost 33 percent of leagues. The contrast is even more striking when you compare Henne to ESPN’s #11 quarterback, Eli Manning, who, despite also being owned in 100 percent of ESPN leagues, has actually put up fewer fantasy points than Henne. It is because of players like Henne that free agency can be an owner’s best friend. Every now and then there will be a player who is flying under the radar but is still producing at the level of a highly ranked player. If you pay attention, you might find one.</p>\n<p>Here are a few more numbers. Maurice Jones-Drew, running back for the Jacksonville Jaguars, is ESPN’s fourth-ranked running back. He has scored a grand total of 20 fantasy points and is owned in 100 percent of leagues. The 40th and 41st ranked running backs, Jason Snelling and Mike Tolbert, have put up 41 and 29 fantasy points respectively, and are both still available in almost 40 percent of leagues. St. Louis Rams wide receiver Mark Clayton, who can still be picked up in 23 percent of leagues, is ranked 30th by ESPN despite scoring nine more fantasy points than sixth-ranked receiver Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p>My point is this: Just because you missed out on the top ten players does not mean you can’t put together a strong team. Instead of memorizing all the bullshit the analysts at ESPN or any other fantasy football site come up with, do some actual research. Track performances each week and keep a close eye on the free agents in your league, because more likely than not, you will find something that somebody else missed.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus staff writer Josh Greenberg spends his days trolling free angency lists, and absolutely nothing else.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26209\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26209\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/","id":2304,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2303,2302,2301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Would Pay Close to $200 Million for New UCen","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-03-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Monday-A.S.-Elections-by-Jenny-Luo-9.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Monday-A.S.-Elections-by-Jenny-Luo-9.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Officials say a proposed University Center renovation plan would cost $48 million, but students could pay more than $193 million if the project ever becomes a reality. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Officials say a proposed University Center renovation plan would cost $48 million, but students could pay more than $193 million if the project ever becomes a reality.</p>\n<p>A.S.

Even with outside donations, the amount students would pay in fees still far exceeds the $48 million total that officials have mentioned.</p>\n<p>If the bill were passed, only part of the student fees would go toward renovating and maintaining the UCen. A much larger portion would go toward paying off loans that the university would take out to finish the job in just four years. The university would need 30 more years to pay off those loans, plus interest.</p>\n<p>The fees would also include administrative costs, which would go to A.S., UCSB administration and financial aid distribution.</p>\n<p>The “NewCen” project, which Le first introduced in late January, would bring the UCen a 24-hour study space, a project laboratory, expanded office space for campus organizations and a central pub.</p>\n<p>Le contends that the time is ripe to “revitalize” the facilities because the UCen was last renovated back in 1994, when UCSB held 8,000 fewer students.</p>\n<p>“The revitalized complex is envisioned as the heart of campus by the UCSB lagoon where students can congregate, eat, socialize, study, work, debate and collaborate,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>If Le can secure 3,116 valid signatures by March 16 and the UC Office of the President gives approval, the NewCen will be placed on the Associated Students elections ballot this April. Then, students could vote to pass the fee by a threshold of 50 percent plus one voter. The fee would take effect in the 2018-19 school year.</p>\n<p>If passed, the renovation would require a $21.42 quarterly student fee until 2022, after which students would pay a $99.61 quarterly fee through 2052.</p>\n<p>The earlier, $21.42 fee is for students who would never see the results of a UCen renovation. Over the following 30 years, UCSB students would continue paying for the renovated building, which would be finished by 2022.</p>\n<p>At Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Le said that it is still “entirely uncertain” if student fees will be needed to pay for the project at all. He mentioned that he may have a “unique opportunity” to work with “big donors” who could offset the total cost of the project.</p>\n<p>First-year history major James Ferraro, who has followed the project’s early development, also estimated a $190 million cost for the project when he spoke at the Senate public forum.</p>\n<p>While the UCSB Office of Development could contribute to the funding, there is a cap to the amount the office could give, Ferraro told the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>In the “best-case scenario,” the office would put $35 million toward funding the renovation, Ferraro said, citing Le’s own estimation at a recent organization meeting. Realistically, the office may contribute between $15 and $35 million.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81849\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81849\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/","id":2302,"author":{"id":28,"name":"Shomik Mukherjee"},"related":[2301,2300,2299],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sunday Funday: Michael Vick, Yay or Nay?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Michael Vick is the fucking man.

As a sports fan, I will be honest: I do not care about his past mistakes. Sure, he has done some beyond horrible things, and it may be naïve, but I just want to watch him do what he does best on Sundays. Is that too much to ask for?</p>\n<p>Apparently not. Last Sunday, in his first full start since 2006, Vick racked up over 300 total yards and four touchdowns. Talk about a comeback.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>By the way, I feel the same about Tiger. Ever since he returned to the tour, I have been rooting for him. Let him fuck all the women he wants — just because he is the greatest golfer in the world doesn’t mean he has to be the best role model in the world. The only reason I am angry at Tiger is just because he may have robbed us, the fans, of the chance to watch the greatest golfer ever dominate in his prime like no one else has.</p>\n<p>Back to Vick. The best Madden player in the game is back at it again. And he may be even better. We all know America loves a redemption story, and Vick is well on his way. He is atoning for his mistakes off the field and on the field, and if you have watched him play at all this season you know what I am talking about. He is as fast as an elite running back, can throw the ball as far as DeSean Jackson can run and catch it and has been surprisingly consistent and smart for a player who recently served 21 months in prison away from football.</p>\n<p>Sure, he showed signs of his former greatness last year, but he wasn’t the same. We wondered if he would ever be the same. I’m just glad that the Eagles are dumb enough to trade Donovan McNabb away.</p>\n<p>Hoping that Kevin Kolb would be McNabb’s apparent heir, ala Aaron Rodgers after Brett Favre’s multiple bullshit retirement routines, the Eagles happily gave Donovan away to a division rival. Then Kolb gets injured. Hey, wait. We have fucking Superman waiting on the bench, let’s let him loose. And Vick has run with it. Like a pitbull — who let the dogs out, baby?!</p>\n<p>But Vick is an alpha-dog. Now that he is finally out of the doghouse, he plays ruff and likes to get his paws dirty.</p>\n<p>On a fantasy note, it’s time to pick him up. Or trade for him. You will probably be rooting for him anyway just because he is so exciting to watch; why not get points for it also? That’s what we call the fantasy double-team.</p>\n<p>So you better believe I will be watching when Donovan McNabb and the division rival Washington Redskins travel to Philly to take on Vick and the Eagles. And yes, I will be rooting for the always-entertaining Vick. Really, how can you not?</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus staff writer Ryan Porush hopes his fantasy team’s not playing against Vick next week…</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26200\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-28/sunday-funday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26200\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-28/sunday-funday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-28/sunday-funday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-28/sunday-funday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-28/sunday-funday/","id":2303,"author":{"id":79,"name":"Ryan Porush"},"related":[2302,2301,2300],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
