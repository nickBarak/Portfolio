So I put all my stickers on.”</p>\n<p>So began the team that would go on to win first place at Startup Weekend, a two-day program on the weekend of Jan. 15-17 in which students launched entrepreneurial projects from scratch.</p>\n<p>Orisun was one of a handful of products to make it to the finals on Sunday, Jan. 17. One team proposed an app called Open, which allows users to keep track of drunk friends. Another group proposed Physique, an app in which users do workouts based on how they want to look.</p>\n<p>The fitness app won third place and Open won second, but the Orisun team placed above the rest because they built a functional prototype on the day of presentation.</p>\n<p>The team developed a simple product: Orisun is a foldable solar reflector able to melt snow on backpacking trips. Users can fold the device into a large cup, and when deployed, Orisun unravels to three-and-a-half feet in diameter. Light rays from the sun hit the shiny Mylar surface, which directs them into a central column for users to heat up water, snow or food.</p>\n<p>Salazar created the circular origami figure made of paper and Mylar on the morning of Sunday, Jan. 17 — the same day the team intended to present. When demonstrated, the Orisun prototype was able to heat up water by one degree every two seconds.</p>\n<p>Judges also commended the Orisun team for making presales and meeting with representatives from REI, Patagonia and National Geographic.</p>\n<p>“We validated our market research maybe a little bit better than others because we actually got money and funding,” Sato said. “That’s one of the best ways to gauge whether people are really going to buy this.”</p>\n<p>She said the team’s competitor sells its product for about $80 to $120, but Orisun can have a market price of $45 to $60. Now, the target market price is somewhere under $100.</p>\n<p>“We have a cheaper solution that has potentially more applications,” she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75229\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75229\" data-attachment-id=\"75229\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/solar-origami-takes-first-at-startup-competition/startup-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Startup 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75229\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=800%2C600\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Startup-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Robert Salazar</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the Orisun team, the applications for their product are broad. It serves a recreational purpose, able to assist a lifestyle of backpacking and trekking. Sailors can use Orisun to heat up ocean water for desalination.</p>\n<p>Team member Srikanth Kalluri, a third-year physics major, said he joined the team because he saw the application of Orisun as an assistance to third-world countries. He sees the solar cooker as a means of separating pollutants from water.</p>\n<p>There is still much more work ahead for Orisun. The team wants to build a final model that is “hiking worthy,” according to Kalluri.</p>\n<p>“Just because we pitched something at a local event doesn’t mean it’s finalized,” he said.</p>\n<p>Sato said they need to secure manufacturing for the product and talk to potential partners, an opportunity that has been opened up from the networking done at Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>For teammate Evan Blasband, a second-year electrical engineering major, winning first place at Startup Weekend is “like a dream come true.”</p>\n<p>“You always hear stories about people starting a business when they’re in college,” he said. “I’ve been wanting to do this stuff for like 10 or 15 years now.”</p>\n<p>Salazar likens the art of origami to our relationship with our environment. The various parts of an origami bird — the beak and the wings — are interdependent and proportionate to one another, and any one small change to any of these features affects all others.</p>\n<p>“What I’d like my origami work to show is that, despite all of this interdependence, you can still create remarkable things, even with something as simple as a sheet of paper,” he said. “Imagine what we could create with our physical world if we follow these principles of interdependence.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily

id=\"caption-attachment-75177\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Oliver Zuniga / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Scientists and global leaders are onboard to preserve oceans this year, with the UCSB Marine Science Institute and the World Economic Forum partnering to bring marine health science to the international stage.</p>\n<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an international organization that focuses on global issues such as water, clean energy and global health. This year, the organization is encouraging political and business global leaders to connect with scientists and brainstorm how to improve ocean health.</p>\n<p>The Marine Science Institute (MSI) was selected to provide a scientific component to the global dialogue about ocean health. The Benioff Ocean Initiative, a program within MSI, will work directly with the WEF to present an ocean health plan at the United Nations Ocean Conference in June.</p>\n<p>“With a campus surrounded by the ocean on three sides, the health of our marine environments is something that is very personal for UCSB,” Pierre Wiltzius, the Susan &amp; Bruce Worster dean of science and executive dean of the College of Letters and Science, said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We also have a reputation as one of the leading institutions for marine research, and we are very proud to continue to foster an interdisciplinary environment that encourages collaboration around vital issues like ocean health,” he said.</p>\n<p>Douglas McCauley, the director of the Benioff Ocean Initiative and an assistant professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, said the WEF is hoping to increase ocean research and health. He said UCSB will be their “guide from the science community.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about whales anymore,” McCauley said, emphasizing the ocean’s modern role in economic, social and political issues.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius emphasized the importance of a dialogue between scientists and global leaders to preserve the marine environments for the future and said he believes the MSI’s leading research will help the “crusade to save our oceans.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that this will elevate the conversation about ocean health to a global level, which is crucial, because oceans affect the entire planet on a global scale,” Wiltzius said in an email. “We need the support of world leaders as we translate our marine science research into action.”</p>\n<p>McCauley recently went to the WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where he presented marine life extinction rates and the importance of improving the state of the ocean. According to McCauley, the WEF was receptive to his information and he is “optimistic” about the ocean’s future.</p>\n<p>“It’s really exciting to see a room full of people that really care and want to learn,” he said. “I think in the science community, people have done a really good job translating what is happening in the oceans into currencies that help global leaders understand that it matters.”</p>\n<p>The ocean’s economic value is $24 trillion, making its wellbeing more than an environmental issue — it’s a global commodity. Additionally, overfishing is a crucial problem affecting the oceans and can have current and future impacts on nutrition and food insecurity, as well as increase international conflicts over fish.</p>\n<p>McCauley said the MSI and WEF will focus their efforts on decreasing overfishing, particularly in the harvesting of tuna fish, and present their plan to the United Nations Ocean Conference this summer.</p>\n<p>“Historically, we thought that oceans couldn’t be overfished … but we figured out we were wrong,” McCauley said. “About one-third of all our global fish docks are overfished.”</p>\n<p>The plan will include combining transparency with sustainability, as well as offering ways to make sustainability more affordable. Some retailers are unwilling to change their consumer habits toward an environmental approach because of the expense of sustainable fishing.</p>\n<p>However, McCauley said many retailers are already joining the environmental effort and he hopes more will join the dialogue by the June meeting in New York.</p>\n<p>The WEF and the United Nations Oceans Conference will be making large steps in their address of global environmental concerns. McCauley expressed worry about the Trump administration’s quiet stance on ocean health, but he said the MSI and WEF’s partnership will allow for global leaders and scientists to address the environment as something more than a national topic.</p>\n<p>“The nice thing about the ocean is that [it] is truly a global commodity, and the future can be decided as an international conversation,” McCauley said.</p>\n<p>McCauley said he is hopeful the MSI and WEF partnership will be able to begin dedicated work for global oceans and make a lasting difference for future generations.</p>\n<p>“We view it as a legacy thing. I have kids, and I have to learn how to pass the ocean in a slightly better state to [them],” he said. “In many ways, this is a great time because everyone in the international community is realizing we need to work together.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Theater. Photo: The Varsity Bike Shop in 1997 <em>via La Cumbre archives</em></p></div>\n<p>One could hardly paint an accurate portrait of the UC Santa Barbara campus without including a few key details: hundreds of bikes lined side-by-side outside lecture halls, thousands of bikes filed bumper-to-bumper en route to classes and, occasionally, two bikes locked together when there is no space on the bike racks.</p>\n<p>George Misbeek, one of the founders of Varsity Bike Shop on Pardall Road, has provided service to UCSB’s bike-savvy students for over 50 years, and he has seen generations walk in and out of his doors.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had so many customers — moms and dads who’d come in with their kids to buy bikes,” Misbeek said. “After several years, the children would come back to buy bikes for their kids.”</p>\n<p>Although Misbeek has seen a large chunk of UCSB bike history, the use of bikes on campus and in Isla Vista dates back decades before his time. It wasn’t until a series of “bike booms” in the 1960s and 1970s, however, that necessity for the human-powered vehicle came to physically shape the campus itself.</p>\n<p>Local historian Britta Gustafson said her impression is that bikes have always been part of Isla Vista, a small neighborhood that underwent development as early as 1925. With no running water or paved roads, I.V. “wasn’t a fancy place,” she said, and was home to many low-income families.</p>\n<p>Bicycles were cheap and popular, “like in any semi-rural beachside community with scattered houses and a bunch of kids,” Gustafson said.</p>\n<p>According to Dennis Whelan, associate campus architect, members of the United States Navy probably used bicycles between 1941 and 1944 when there was a U.S. Marine Corps base in place of the university.</p>\n<p>UCSB later moved into the former Marine base buildings, he said, and cyclists would ride on roadways and walkways or they would create their own dirt paths in what were “the very early and dusty days of campus.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72190\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72190\" data-attachment-id=\"72190\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/1-6-2013-first-day-of-winter-quarter-peter-vandenbelt-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=1600%2C966&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,966\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"1.6.2013 First day of Winter Quarter   Peter Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?fit=888%2C536&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72190\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4-1024x618.jpg?resize=888%2C536\" alt=\"1.6.2013 First day of Winter Quarter / Peter Vandenbelt / Nexus File Photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C618&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=250%2C151&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Day-1-of-Winter-2014-Peter-Vandenbelt-4.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72190\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus file photo</p></div>\n<p>There was a particular “cycle boom” amongst UCSB students in the 1960s, as noted by a 1964 headline in El Gaucho (a predecessor to the Nexus). The story reported 23 accidents and 659 bike thefts in the 1963-1964 school year, events that campus police considered a “major problem” to address the following school year.</p>\n<p>Misbeek took advantage of this “cycle boom” when he and two other friends started Varsity Bike Shop on Sept. 18, 1964, a date he quickly recalls today.</p>\n<p>The founder, now 87 years old, said bikes were well in use by the time he had set up shop in a building where “they hadn’t even got all the walls in yet.” He and his co-owners were “optimistic” of the store’s future; they anticipated continuing growth for the university, both in enrollment numbers and in the physical size of the campus.</p>\n<p>Some might say the optimism was well-founded. These were the years, after all, when the largest-ever generation at the time — the baby boomers — started their postsecondary education. A UCSB Planning data book indicates 4,865 students enrolled in the 1962 Fall Quarter, which increased to 5,938 students in the 1963 Fall Quarter and 7,879 students a year after that.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the campus underwent rapid expansion in size. According to Whelan, university developers completed six buildings in 1966 alone: the Engineering building, the Chemistry building, the University Center (UCen), Carrillo dining commons, Buchanan Hall and Phelps Hall.</p>\n<p>With a larger campus than ever before, Misbeek said walking to class quickly became inconvenient. Biking, he said, was increasingly necessary for students to arrive to class on time.</p>\n<p>Varsity Bike Shop could hardly keep up with demand. Misbeek remembers opening at 6 a.m. and working nonstop until as late as 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>He would buy several large containers of 350 bikes, “all of them black three-speeds.” It would only take about six weeks, he said, to sell an entire container of bikes, each priced from $39 to $49 in 1964. Three to four years later, the same bikes were selling at $70 to $80.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72185\" style=\"width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72185\" data-attachment-id=\"72185\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/bikes-from-la-cumbre-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?fit=1397%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1397,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bikes from LA CUMBRE-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?fit=175%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?fit=715%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-72185\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4-715x1024.jpg?resize=715%2C1024\" alt=\"Cielo Calderon / La Cumbre 1997\" width=\"715\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?resize=715%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 715w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?resize=175%2C250&amp;ssl=1 175w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1099&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bikes-from-LA-CUMBRE-4.jpg?w=1397&amp;ssl=1 1397w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-72185\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">El Gaucho archives</p></div>\n<p>Before building its first bike paths in the late 1960s, the university only had walkways going through campus. Bikers rode on the sides of the walkways, where cyclists were supposed to be as indicated in a “set of regulations” posted in a 1963 El Gaucho article.</p>\n<p>The university developed the first stretch of bike path in August 1966, which provided travel along El Colegio Road between Francisco Torres (now San Clemente residence hall) and the campus pool. It was a “class one” bike path — a lane exclusively for bikes on the side of a shared road — and may have been the very first of its kind for Santa Barbara County, according to Whelan.</p>\n<p>“You can see a remnant on the west side of the track, opposite Student Health,” Whelan said in an email. “It is much-degraded asphalt now that appears to be a walkway.”</p>\n<p>The university continued to develop its bike system throughout much of the 1960s and 1970s as enrollment numbers grew and capital funds became available for the building of underpasses and bike circles.</p>\n<p>Of the several paths following the first, developers created a “central bikeway” in 1969 that ran east-west from the Student Health underpass to Kerr Hall. It was in 1970 that the university developed its iconic bike path, the Arts Mall Bikeway, running from Pardall tunnel to the Arts building.</p>\n<p>The campus bike system became especially necessary in the 1970s, a decade in which biking became even more popular than the one before.</p>\n<p>A Time magazine article, published in June 1971, reported on a national shortage of bicycles as the result of the “bicycle’s biggest wave of popularity in its 154-year history.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_72189\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"704828842\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72291\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72189\" data-attachment-id=\"72189\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-25/bikes-gauchos-ride-or-die/bike_lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=2000%2C1111&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1111\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?fit=888%2C493&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-72189 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=888%2C493\" alt=\"Nexus file photo\" width=\"888\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=250%2C139&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=768%2C427&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?resize=1024%2C569&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bike_Lorenzo-Basilio.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72189\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus file photo</p></div>\n<p>The article notes that bicycles were seen as a solution for many groups of the time. Environmentalists chose them as a non-pollutant alternative to cars.</p>\n<p>“Physical-fitness fans” saw the bike as a “heart preserver.” Workers in “traffic-choked cities” would begin commuting on bicycles to beat rush-hour traffic.<br>\nUCSB was certainly not left out of the nationwide bicycle movement.</p>\n<p>Former California State Senator James Mills once made an 11-day bike trip from San Francisco to San Diego in September 1972 to campaign for Proposition 20, which eventually passed and formed the California Coastal Commission. One of the overnight stops for him and his group of cyclists was the Devereux House on UCSB’s west campus.</p>\n<p>As the 1970s progressed, the university added several stretches of bike path to its existing system. Among many other projects, the university built the segment between UCen Road and the Arbor in 1973 and the path from the Arbor to the south side of the library in 1977.</p>\n<p>In 1978, developers completed one of the final additions to the campus bike system: the bike circle next to Storke Tower. This is the same bike circle in which, during the opening week of fall classes, some students set up lawn chairs to watch new cyclists timidly navigate through the roundabout for the first time, hoping to see a crash.</p>\n<p>Today, UCSB has approximately seven miles of dedicated bike path, enough to provide travel for thousands of students, faculty and staff every day. For every year since 2011, the League of American Bicyclists has given UCSB “gold level” designation on its list of “bike friendly universities.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, bikes are so historically well received on campus, it makes sense that the bike racks are nearly always full. As reminisced in his song “Do You Remember,” such is the dilemma UCSB alumnus Jack Johnson ran into when he was “late for class” and could find no room to park his bike outside I.V. Theater. He saw the bike of a girl he met in Ortega dining commons (not the DLG as one might assume from “Bubble Toes”), the one with the “painted flowers on it,” and locked his to hers instead.</p>\n<p>But UCSB’s busy bike culture isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it won Jack Johnson a lunch date with the woman who would later become his wife.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the

Nazari was known as the “Roofless Barber” in high school because he used to cut hair outside, and the name now appears on his business cards.</p>\n<p>“My principal caught me once and was like, ‘You can’t be doing this,’ and I still kept doing it,” he said. “And the janitors knew me, they would leave a broom out for me.”</p>\n<p>At UCSB, Nazari first started cutting hair after an icebreaker.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Hi, I’m Gilbert, and I cut hair,’ and I ended up running out of 250 cards. And it’s only been two months,” Nazari said.</p>\n<p>In his time at UCSB, Nazari has worked with approximately 40 clients. At a price tag of $13, his haircuts are cheaper than most nearby hair salons.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73667\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1239892528\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73658\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73667\" data-attachment-id=\"73667\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/uc-santa-barber-first-year-student-runs-authentic-salon-out-of-anacapa/30512299552_313359464e_o/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"5184,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"30512299552_313359464e_o\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73667\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Nazari apprenticed for two years, and hopes to give each of his clients a professional barbering experience. \" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=5184&amp;ssl=1 5184w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/30512299552_313359464e_o.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nazari brought all his barbering tools from home, and is allowed to operate in the dorms as long as he cleans up after each appointment. <em>Courtesy Nathan Mai</em></p></div>\n<p>He has already established several regulars; one customer has returned three times in the two months that he’s been here.</p>\n<p>“$13 and he’ll spend over 30 minutes cutting your hair,” said Vijay Parameswaran, first-year economics major who was particularly shaggy prior to his haircut. “Great customer service and he’s really easy to talk to.
