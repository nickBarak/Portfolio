Geck ruled the UC Regents failed to provide a fair hearing for the accused student, known in court documents as John Doe, in a Title IX investigation. UCSB expelled Doe in November 2016 after a student filed a Title IX complaint against him that June.</p>\n<p>The student who filed the complaint, referred to as Jane Roe in court documents, said Doe stalked her on a daily basis after the two engaged in a sexual encounter in November 2015 and briefly dated.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX investigator Brian Quillen determined the stalking offense, among others, “more likely than not did occur,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Following his expulsion, Doe attempted twice to appeal the decision: once with the Interpersonal Violence Appeal Review Committee (IPVARC) at UCSB in December 2016 and then again with the California Superior Court in December 2017, contending that the initial investigation had not been fair.</p>\n<p>While the IPVARC did not find issues with the procedures of the Title IX case, Geck found issues with the IPVARC’s review. Namely, she agreed with Doe’s argument that UCSB’s internal policies were “Confusing, Internally Inconsistent, and Unfair,” and she lifted his expulsion and ordered his case be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>The IPVARC panel reconvened in February 2018 and mirrored its original decision, once again expelling Doe.</p>\n<p>Doe returned to court in June to contend that his case had not been seriously reconsidered by the IPVARC, citing the language of the original and new decision to show they were almost exactly the same, minus one introductory sentence in the latter to address the court’s complaint.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Geck ruled the new decision was “merely a poorly rewritten decision that appears to be a justification for the earlier result,” finding UCSB in contempt of the court and annulling the panel’s decision.</p>\n<p>Doe now has the option to return to the UC system beginning Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Prior to filing the Title IX complaint, Roe filed a harassment report with the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) in May 2016. After the SBSO investigation determined there was no evidence of Doe’s alleged misconduct, she then filed the Title IX complaint.</p>\n<p>Roe stated Doe, following the initial encounter, had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>followed her “to and from her classes for nearly an entire academic year on a daily basis”;</li>\n<li>“had an unidentified third-party call Roe three times… threatened to kill her, rape her”;</li>\n<li>“waited outside of Roe’s apartment building for her”;</li>\n<li>and “deliberately maintained close proximity to Jane Roe and her boyfriend and engaged in conduct directed at her and her boyfriend” while at a sorority event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, Roe alleged she said “no” multiple times during the November 2015 encounter, while Doe stated Roe provided “affirmative consent” throughout.</p>\n<p>Doe cited text messages sent between Doe’s former roommate and Roe to prove to the court that the encounter had been consensual. One of the text messages, sent by Roe the night of the Nov. encounter, read: “The truth is, if I had been waxed and more prepared, it would have gone further.”</p>\n<p>Roe later stated these messages were sent in an attempt to cope with the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>In his statement to the court, Doe denied Roe’s allegations and alleged that she had aggressively pursued him after their initial sexual encounter in Nov., offering anecdotal evidence to demonstrate he had initially been reluctant to enter into a relationship with her.</p>\n<p>He alleged Roe, following the initial encounter, had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“started frequently appearing in Doe’s room unannounced and uninvited”;</li>\n<li>“frequently stayed in the lounge of [his] residence hall, in his room, or outside his door for long periods of time” to the extent that he “no longer felt safe in his residence hall”;</li>\n<li>would “come to John Doe’s residence hall to party and drink alcohol”;</li>\n<li>“put up posters around John Doe’s residence hall and all over campus containing a diatribe against her alleged ‘sexual offender,’ with the objective of intimidating and harassing [him].”;</li>\n<li>and told him she would “file a restraining order against him” if he did not agree to meet with a mediator of her choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe initially made a formal complaint to UCSB about the “harassment and stalking” by Jane Roe in December 2015. Doe said he left the school temporarily before the quarter ended to “escape the stressful situation,” alleging his grades suffered due to Roe’s harassment.</p>\n<p>Once he returned to UCSB, he requested a room change and was then allowed to move out of his residence hall.</p>\n<p>However, Doe argued in his court case that none of his allegations were taken seriously by Title IX investigator Quillen. Instead, he argued Quillen was biased in the investigation and failed to provide him with the resources he was entitled to in order to defend himself adequately.</p>\n<p>The University of California Office of the President is considering <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/title-ix/\">potential amendments</a> to its system-wide policy following a federal investigation that revealed UC Berkeley violated Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>If approved, several changes would aim to address concerns similar to those brought up by Doe in his case.</p>\n<p>The amendments would include clarifying the types of evidence to be included in an investigation, outlining the contents of a formal notice of charges, providing students with the option to question the other party through the investigator and mandating consistent training for the appeal board.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

They also draw pictures that convey their emotions in a healthy and metaphorical way, Morgan said. <em>Courtesy of Michael Morgan</em></p></div>\n<p>For the program, Morgan brings together eight UCSB students and eight incarcerated teenagers from Los Prietos Boys’ Camp (LPBC), a juvenile detention facility in Santa Barbara County. He uses theater, dance and art techniques to address issues related to class and culture.</p>\n<p>The class spends six weeks rehearsing their own rendition of Homer’s <em>Odyssey </em>from June 25 to August 4. At the end of the course, participants perform at Center Stage Theater in downtown Santa Barbara, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The program grew out of a class called “The People’s Voice,” which is also taught by Morgan and is offered during Summer Session A.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the class was to create a partnership between UCSB undergraduates and the community,” Morgan said. “It’s theater with a social justice bent.”</p>\n<p>The class is six weeks long and meets Tuesday through Thursday for about four hours each day, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>This program, which is the first and only of its kind, was started in 2011 when Morgan was looking for a way to bridge the gap between “privileged” and “non-privileged” people in the community.</p>\n<p>He said he wanted to create a space where they could interact in a way that promoted deeper communication and understanding between both sides, which is the basis for<em> The Odyssey Project</em>.</p>\n<p>“Coming from … my own background, I understand some of the difficulties people have to face if they’re not always privileged,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Morgan, who has been a lecturer at UCSB since1992, said he chose to focus on <em>The Odyssey </em>for his program because he felt it had a storyline that both students and troubled teens could relate to.</p>\n<p>“They become the heroes and heroines in their journey home to Ithaca,” he said.</p>\n<p>The students and incarcerated teenagers that participate in this program write stories about the struggles they currently deal with. They also draw pictures that convey their emotions in a healthy and metaphorical way, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Morgan is the primary professor of the course, but also gets help from a mime teacher, mask maker, hip-hop choreographer, rap artist and costume designer.</p>\n<p>The location of the class alternates between UCSB and LPBC, which is located in Los Padres National Forest. This allows UCSB students to receive more context about the world and what the life of an incarcerated teenager is like, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>“There’s this location exchange, but also there’s a kind of cultural exchange because we have … the free and the incarcerated in a dialogue,” he explained. “The UC students benefit from [the program] because … [the teens and students] start to bond with each other.”</p>\n<p>Youth who are admitted into LPBC stay there for either 120 or 180 days, according to the LPBC website.</p>\n<p>“The goal of LPBC is to return youth to the community as responsible and productive members of society,” the website states.</p>\n<p>Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 are admitted into LPBC and are expected to attend the camp’s school while they are there, according to the website.</p>\n<p>Morgan said one of his main hopes is that the theater program will inspire teens who graduate from LPBC to go to college afterwards.</p>\n<p>“I usually take youth age 16 to 17. It’s an important transition in their life because … if they continue to violate [the law] basically they go to adult prisons,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>There have been numerous accounts in which incarcerated teens work toward getting into college after completing the <em>The Odyssey Project,</em> according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>“[This program] show[ed] me that we could mature ourselves. We could work, not be lazy. We can go to college, have a good job and get good money instead of being on the streets and selling drugs. That’s not going to get you anywhere,” said Diego, a youth who attended the program in 2015.</p>\n<p>Morgan said he believes the performance the students and teenagers put on at the end of the course encourages community members and political leaders in Santa Barbara to address these teenagers in a more compassionate way.</p>\n<p>Relatives and friends of the actors, as well as community groups and leaders, attend this typically sold-out show, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The people in the crowd can “really make a difference” in the lives of the teenagers who perform, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>“Once [the students and teenagers] do that show… they’re throwing a ball to the public saying … ‘They also need to step up to us, we’re a part of that society,’” he said.</p>\n<p>This year, Morgan expanded this project to a maximum security correctional facility in Ventura County. The men at this facility range in age from 17 to 22. Due to safety concerns, the practices and performance are held within the correctional grounds.</p>\n<p>This “abbreviated” version of the program is four weeks long and is currently underway, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge in organizing the class and performance is “getting the word out” and getting students from UCSB to participate in this kind of work, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>Morgan has begun to write up a “training manual” for this course that includes the strategies employed so that other people can start similar programs as well. He is also producing a documentary to spread awareness about the project.</p>\n<p>The possibility of continuation for the project will be determined in following years by enrollment numbers, funding and the amount of help from other staff members, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The next performance of <em>The Odyssey Project </em>at the Ventura location is scheduled for June 8.</p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on p.4 of the May 31 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Gessesse</em></p></div>\n<p>The North Hall Takeover of 1968 led to the creation of the Black Studies department, which now offers a diverse set of courses encompassing traditional subjects like the history of black Americans as well as more specialized courses detailing Caribbean studies, the black radical tradition and the history of jazz music.</p>\n<p>Professor Jeffrey Stewart, who works in the department and helped organize the North Hall Takeover: 50 Years After conference that took place at UC Santa Barbara earlier this month, is proud of the growth the department has seen since its creation.</p>\n<p>“We feel that our very existence here is due to their vision and their activism, so we try to honor that with these anniversary celebrations,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>The creation of the Black Studies department also set the groundwork for other departments such as the Chicanx Studies department, the Feminist Studies department and the Asian American Studies department.</p>\n<p>“There’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the black experience of America that all students can benefit from and there’s a body of knowledge that’s come out of the Chicano experience of America that can be useful for all students,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>Stewart cites a “critical apparatus” and activism as the two leading tenets of the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>Not only does the department teach its students to be critical consumers of the information presented to them, but it also emphasizes the need for activism and the role it’s played in creating the America we live in today, he said.</p>\n<p>“Activism sometimes is looked down on in the larger political landscape but I think if you look at change in America, much of it has come about because people have been activists,” he said.</p>\n<p>Despite its growth, the department is currently struggling with a shortage of professors.</p>\n<p>While Stewart said the problem is mostly temporary due to professors who have passed away or recently left, he said the larger problem is the lack of attention to the humanities as a whole.</p>\n<p>“The university is internationally known for its science and engineering, so that’s kind of what they’re always emphasizing,” said Stewart said.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to interdisciplinary departments like black studies, feminist studies… sometimes it’s a struggle to get administrators to see that part of the education here is not just getting technical education, it’s education to become a citizen, and to be a globally aware citizen.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has a long history of activism, particularly within the Black Student Union (BSU).</p>\n<p>BSU students are currently working to update the demands from 2012 and cite their two biggest concerns as the resources available for black educators and the “recruitment and retention of black students,” according to BSU Chair Mariyah Lewis.</p>\n<p>“Seeing how the office engages with the retention and recruitment of black students… is one of the indicative efforts of how strong and how serious the demands are, ranging from 1968 all the way to 2012,” said Alexandra Gessesse, whose position in the Office of Admissions as diversity intern was a direct result of previous BSU demands.</p>\n<p>Dalton Nezey, one of the original members of the North Hall Takeover, echoed similar sentiments in establishing strong, consistent professors in the Black Studies department.</p>\n<p>“I wanted [the professors] to be caretakers of the history of black studies and the history of blacks on this campus,” Nezey said.</p>\n<p>Samantha Sanchez, who is leading the seven-member BSU demands team, says most of the demands have received money allocated toward their completion.</p>\n<p>The team is now responsible for making sure the money is used correctly.</p>\n<p>The demands are constantly evolving, as the needs of black students at UCSB evolve, and Sanchez says the main goal of the demands team is to “assess the state of the black community on campus.”</p>\n<p>“What we have left right now is just to ensure the overall well-being of black students and black people on campus,” she added.</p>\n<p>The addition of two black psychologists in Counseling and Psychological Services and the creation of the diversity intern position in the Admissions Office are two of the demands from 2012 that have already been met.</p>\n<p>There are still many demands left incomplete, however, including one asking for a display in North Hall memorializing the North Hall Takeover and a database of contact information for black students to allow for faculty or BSU leaders to “extend resources to our community more systematically and rigorously,” according to the 2012 demands.</p>\n<p>“I think that the things that we’re implementing will allow for us to see change happen in a very institutional and lasting way,” Sanchez said. “I’m excited to see where it goes after I graduate.”</p>\n<p><i>A
