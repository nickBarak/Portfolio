cyber security officials talk safety after scammers sent suspicious emails to UCSB students and administration \"phishing\" for login info.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Alejandra Sanchez opened an email from UCSB last week, she noticed something wasn’t quite right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looked suspicious because it was a blank email with a small link on it from an unfamiliar name,” the fourth-year psychology major said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon seeing a surprising lack of contact information for the university, which is usually found on university notices, Sanchez deleted the email.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez, along with many UCSB students, received a fake email last week to her umail account from a source claiming to be from the university, warning that her email was restricted and required verification to be accessed. The students were urged to click on a provided link, which would send them to a website where they could type their username and password to retrieve their email account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers are reaching UCSB email accounts through “phishing,” a multi-billion-dollar underground illegal business in which scammers send forged emails to a pool of email users and wait for users to respond to the message. While Sanchez did not respond to the “phishing” bait, many students did, releasing their usernames and passwords and allowing their accounts to be used in other phishing attempts by scammers.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, a similar email was sent to UCSB staff, and 16 members released their login information to the dangerous site. These unsecure emails are not the first of their kind and pose a variety of threats to email users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once scammers have a username and login, they could use it as a gateway to access other accounts or look into students’ academic and personal records.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief information security officer, phishing is “very common and fairly easy to do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are bad guys in the world,” Horowitz said. “This is kind of the nature of what email and criminal … activity look like today.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing is common in many countries, including those formerly part of the Eastern Block and some unexpected countries such as Germany and the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of former Soviet countries are places we see hotbeds of activity,” said Joe McClain, the director of student systems I.T. infrastructure, security &amp; user support of UCSB’s Student Systems and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, China is on the list; there’s a lot of stuff happening in China, but there’re also countries you would never expect that would show up on the radar.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said unsecure emails are becoming more “sophisticated” to look like emails sent from legitimate organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When spammers go phishing, they are throwing a lure out there to see how many people bite on it,” McClain said. The more refined the email, the more likely people will trust it and release personal information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spammers are not only interested in accessing singular email addresses, but look for addresses that are trusted and widely used, like the umail server.

She said she often found it difficult to focus on her schoolwork when she was so hungry that she felt nauseous.</p>\n<p>“One of my main concerns was worrying about not being able to focus on studying for an exam because I was hungry,” Nguyen said in an email. “It’s quite difficult to make the best out of your education when you’re focused on how you’re going to get access to your next meal [or] cook for your next meal.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen’s story is similar to the realities of many other UC students who find it hard to eat healthy and consistently with a college budget and rigorous student lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative.”</p>\n<p>— Juli Nguyen</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a spring 2015 survey from the UC, which was taken by 8,932 of 66,000 UC students, 42 percent of UC students struggled with poor quality food and insufficient sustenance in the past year.</p>\n<p>In response to the survey results, President Janet Napolitano announced Monday that she will allocate $3.3 million of the UC funds to help students struggling with food insecurity on behalf of the university’s Global Food Initiative. Each campus will receive $151,000 of the allocated amount.</p>\n<p>Among the focuses of the Global Food Initiative’s plan, the UC mentions the expansion of campus’ food pantry storage and access, an increase of student registration in CalFresh, the state’s nutrition assistance program and improved financial communication about the cost of food and living for students.</p>\n<p>Paul Monge, a UC Berkeley law student, UCSB alumnus and Student Regent designate, will work with Napolitano on projects to increase food security and said it is important for universities to receive more funding from the state rather than relying primarily on student tuition.</p>\n<p>“The university system is increasingly reliant on tuition and fees as their main source of revenue as opposed to state revenue,” Monge said. “The burden of paying for the universities … is placed on students and how that is translating is increase in prevalence of food insecurity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61697\"

funding support the food bank’s expansion, adding that the current lack of funding is “keeping us from providing more for students that need it the most.”</p>\n<p>The survey also showed that 57 percent of students who now go hungry did not experience food problems during childhood, making this an even more “serious issue,” according to Katie Maynard, the UCSB Sustainability Coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Students may require additional information about crisis resources, financial aid, and making healthy choices on a limited budget” as they handle food inaccessibility for the first time, Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students do not feel comfortable seeking assistance on the issue, however, causing them to “struggle in privacy,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>“I think what many of us don’t realize is that hunger can happen to anyone at any single time,” she said in an email. “If you go into I.V., it’s packed with people eating delicious food at a bunch of restaurants, but we don’t account for the percentage of students who are currently at home and hungry.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said UCSB’s Food Security Task Force will manage the $151,000 allocated to UCSB and plan to prioritize more options for low-income students, including the Certified Farmers’ Market and associated Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life.”</p>\n<p>— Paul Monge</p></blockquote>\n<p>She also said the task force will hire eight students so they can analyze solutions offered at other campuses and expand existing programs.</p>\n<p>According to Monge, the cost of housing and food security is not typically associated with the affordability of college, which leads to a system wide lack of focus on students’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life,” Monge said. “We really need to reframe the narrative about what the university has responsibility over in terms of … students.”</p>\n<p>Despite being an upperclassman who uses the A.S. Food Bank, Nguyen finds herself struggling to make food a priority in her busy schedule. The news of the new UC initiative “excites” her and she hopes it will increase discussion about a battle that so many students fight each day.</p>\n<p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative,” Nguyen said in an email. “I’m glad that [food insecurity] is getting the attention it needs and I hope this attention becomes more and more public as we progress.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Chen was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-10/former-student-arrested-in-2014-campus-rape-case/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in San Ramon on Feb. 10, 2016 and charged with two counts of rape and is currently being held without bail in the Santa Barbara County Jail awaiting trial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the lawsuit, the UC Regents motioned to strike four specific portions of its text, saying the allegations were not valid enough to carry out legal action.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Donna Geck on June 28 overruled the Regent’s challenge with </span><a href=\"http://www.sbcourts.org/os/tr/tentative-detail.php?RuleID=48964\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for each of the plaintiff’s allegations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among four claims, the Regents said the lawsuit did not explain how the foliage-covered area created a “forseeable risk” for the plaintiff’s injuries. The lawsuit, however, alleges that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the university had “previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred in this area.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are more than sufficient allegations to support the inference that it was foreseeable that a student walking in the area, particularly a female student, might be the victim of a sexual assault or other criminal activity,” the court ruled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents also argued that the plaintiff failed to explain how the area was dangerous and describe how the “dangerous condition” led to the plaintiff’s injuries. The court rejected both of the arguments and the the lawsuit will proceed in its original form. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents had approximately 10 days to respond to the court’s ruling, and the plaintiff and defendant will now begin negotiating whether the case will go to trial or end with a settlement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyrone Maho, an attorney representing the plantiff, said the woman is still hoping for a settlement in the case.</span></p>\n<p>“She wants accountability, not just by the people that did this to her, but for the university to allow this dangerous condition to exist,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attorneys representing both parties will hold the next status conference on Sept. 16. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71854\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71854\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-09/regents-challenge-to-campus-rape-case-fails/","id":2470,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2469,2468,2467],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
