The university opened the investigation after it discovered a 19-second video in which Doe and his ex-girlfriend argued on camera before the screen went black.</p>\n<p>University officials said the video “amply justified” Doe’s suspension while the university conducted a Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>Doe filed a complaint against the university in December 2016 to remove the interim suspension and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned to school in April</a> 2017.</p>\n<p>Judge Thomas Anderle of the Santa Barbara Superior Court ruled against the imposed suspension in the March court order, citing the university’s concealment of evidence as a cause and calling the university “seriously prejudiced” in its actions.</p>\n<p>“This court disagrees with UCSB’s claim that the University’s use of the detective’s summaries in issuing the interim suspension does not violate his due process rights,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “John Doe is entitled to know all the information against him at the hearing, not via emailing his counsel allegedly critical and decisive information at a later time.”</p>\n<p>Bob Ottilie, Doe’s lawyer, submitted an amended complaint to Anderle in July alleging that the university concealed evidence from Doe and violated his right to due process.</p>\n<p>According to the court order and complaint, former director of judicial affairs Sandra Vasquez withheld two police emails from Doe during a hearing with him on Sept., 22, 2016 that the university used in the investigation. One email included statements by third parties attributed to Doe’s ex-girlfriend, Jane Doe.</p>\n<p>Anderle found that the university never contacted Jane Doe to corroborate the statements.</p>\n<p>After the hearing, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn made the decision to continue Doe’s suspension until the conclusion of the Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>The court received the evidence in March days before a court hearing on March 21. At the hearing, Klawunn said under oath she had considered the two pieces of concealed evidence in making her decision.</p>\n<p>The university declined to comment on the case.</p>\n<p>Vasquez has since left her position at UCSB and is now the dean of students at Pitzer College. Vasquez could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In an email to the Pitzer student body in August in response to allegations of concealing evidence from Doe, however, Vasquez said she has “never concealed material evidence in any case.”</p>\n<p>Anderle also said in the court ruling that the university took too long to investigate, the<em> Nexus</em> reported in April, failing to conclude the Title IX investigation within the 60 calendar day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60 business day deadline required by the university.</p>\n<p>The Title IX investigation is still ongoing, and the university has not placed charges on the student or interviewed any key witnesses.<br>\nThe judge also ruled that the university caused Doe “irreparable harm” in barring him from the majority of his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he is “confident” Doe’s record will ultimately be cleared due to the evidence in support of the student and Judge Anderle’s ruling in March.</p>\n<p>“If charged and convicted, we are just going to go back to court with the same record and the same judge and ask the judge to throw it out — which we’re confident he would,” Ottilie said.</p>\n<p>In a letter from Ottilie to the UC Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, Ottilie expressed concern that the university mistreated Doe through the suspension because he is a minority student and unable to legally contest due to lack of financial resources.</p>\n<p>According to the March court ruling, Doe has incurred more than $100,000 in attorney’s fees since his filing in December. Ottilie said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday that Doe is currently unable to pay the expenses.</p>\n<p>The United States Department of Education accepted the case for further investigation of potential Title IX and VI policy violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Department of Education’s website, Title IX “prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex” and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition

President Hieu Le proposed a plan to renovate the UCen building, which could increase student fees by $20 per student per quarter. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCen/Student Union Renovation and Expansion project goal is to “address critical building infrastructure needs of the UCen,” according to the first draft of the resolution submitted to Senate.</p>\n<p>The first draft of the resolution was tabled indefinitely, and a new one was passed at the Jan. 31 Senate meeting, reaffirming support for Le’s plan.</p>\n<p>Senator Grecia Martinez authored and Senator Kian Maalizadeh seconded the first draft of the original resolution. Maalizadeh authored and Martinez seconded the Jan. 31 affidavit resolution.</p>\n<p>“I have high hopes for it, and I want other students to believe in it,” Martinez said of Le’s plan.</p>\n<p>A.S. Community Outreach Coordinator James Ferraro spoke against the first resolution during the public forum during Wednesday’s Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>Ferraro, who met with Le earlier, said Le had stated that the project would require a student fee increase that could reach as high as $300 a year beginning in five years. Until then, the project would require a $20 increase per student per quarter.</p>\n<p>“That’s a 48 million dollar project, as I mentioned, and I think it’s a lot to ask from students to pay for the majority of that cost,” Ferraro said. “A lot of students have a very tough financial burden, and every dollar really counts for them.”</p>\n<p>Le declined the <em>Nexus’</em> request for comment, but spoke to the Senate later and confirmed the potential costs of the new project for students.</p>\n<p>He said the project has a $48 million budget which would be funded through a combination of student fees and fundraising, and that the fees would range from $21 to $99 per quarter. The project, however, is still in its preliminary stages; Le will need to collect signatures to get the measure on the ballot for the 2018 A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>He said the plan would include an approximately $50 million return for students with financial aid to supplement the fee for students who could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p>Ferraro explained that the current proposal doesn’t include any financial commitment from the university aside from setting up a fundraiser that would solicit funds from alumni donors.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of you really opposed when the UC Regents or when [the] university is really trying to raise our fees and you guys really fight and you’re great leaders on that,” Ferraro said to the senators.</p>\n<p>“But I think when it comes to this and when it comes to internal funding, I think you really have to be careful and really pay attention to what they’re asking for, especially Office of the President,” he added.</p>\n<p>The original resolution references a 2012 space survey which states that “38% of A.S. entities has no assigned space, while a quarter of A.S. entities used temporary or shared spaces. A.S. is located in seven different buildings on campus making it difficult for students to collaborate and integrate their ideas, projects, and communications.”</p>\n<p>The resolution proposed the expansion and renovation of the UCen because it is nearly $2 million in debt and the majority of the businesses are not successful. It also states that the interior and exterior need to be remodeled for general aesthetics “in order to have a comparative advantage over other elite universities.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also references the UCSB Long Range Development Plan 2025, which calls for an annual one percent growth of students until UCSB reaches a capacity of 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>Le created a task force to revisit the Student Union Revitalization Fund (S.U.R.F.), which had been originally created by previous A.S. president Jonathan Abboud in 2013, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The S.U.R.F. proposal received approval from the Campus Planning Community, Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fischer, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young, Chancellor Henry Yang and A.S. when it was first proposed in 2014.</p>\n<p>Le’s task force would assess the “internal needs” of A.S. and update the S.U.R.F. proposal. The updated plan provides 40 percent more program area than the previous concept and “[addresses] critical building infrastructure needs of the UCen.”</p>\n<p>Proposed spaces that would also be refined would include the A.S. Bike Shop, the A.S. Food Bank relocation and expansions, A.S. Senate Chambers, A.S. Recycling Center relocation, A.S. office improvements and an Environmental Sustainability Resource Center.</p>\n<p>The original resolution states that Senate stands in “full support” of Le’s project and described the project as “well-needed” and “long-overdue.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ferraro was mistakenly named as a San Miguel Hall Council Member. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-78887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Campbell Nolan / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Today, at 82 years old, Kirtman says he never guessed he would be the longest active teaching professor at UCSB.</p>\n<p>With vast knowledge of chemistry and university history as well as a witty sense of humor, Kirtman is the kind of professor who prompts the image of a long conversation over a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>He instantly make guests feel welcome in his paper-cluttered office on the fourth floor of the chemistry building.</p>\n<p>Kirtman is a professor in the chemistry department and specializes in the quantum theory of electronic structure, which requires predicting the properties of all chemical systems based on the electronic motions in their atomic systems.</p>\n<p>Born on March 30, 1935, and originally from New York, Kirtman went to Columbia University for undergraduate studies and received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Harvard University in 1961.</p>\n<p>The year 1965 was an exciting time for UCSB because the campus was expanding geographically and academically, Kirtman said.</p>\n<p>“The campus had decided to grow and I think that’s part of why I came here,” Kirtman said. “It was going to grow into a major research university.”</p>\n<p>“I get lost walking on the campus myself,” he joked, adding that the many construction projects over the years have transformed the university. The chemistry building where his office is located was not yet constructed when Kirtman began teaching in 1965.</p>\n<p>As Kirtman reflected on his most memorable moments at UCSB, he recalled the Vietnam War as a critical turning point in politics on campus and in the university’s academic curriculum.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said during the war he was responsible for managing a crisis courses program, in which professors could alter their class syllabi to include information about the operation in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>“Professors could either participate in that program and change the orientation of their course for a quarter to meet what was going on in Vietnam, or continue the way they were going,” Kirtman explained.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman did not reorganize his own classes on quantum theory to address the Vietnam War, he created a course for all students on the social responsibility of scientists in response to the war.</p>\n<p>“At the very beginning of the course, I had to reorient the class to develop the scientific way of thinking about things,” he said, noting that scientists and humanists differ in the way they reach conclusions and answers to problems.</p>\n<p>In bridging scientific thinking and social issues, Kirtman connected the way science was becoming increasingly political and addressed how scientists should be vocal in scientific political dialogue.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said his own son researches climate science at the University of Miami in Florida and said he hopes his son becomes involved in the political debate surrounding climate change.</p>\n<p>“I often say, ‘The lawyers think they can abolish the law of thermodynamics, which is a scientific law you can’t abolish,’ ” he said with a chuckle. “Science is made political by politicians and it is a very important issue right now.”</p>\n<p>Kirtman said he is most proud of his work with students who have gone on to careers in chemistry as well as his own research conducted in quantum theory.</p>\n<p>“There’s been a lot of individual research moments when the light bulb went on,” he said.</p>\n<p>He is especially proud of the “revolutionary” work he did with quantum theory as applied to electric fields interacting with crystalline materials. This work was featured in a symposium in Rhodes, Greece, in 2009.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman said he certainly has favorite students, he said he believes any student can be successful if they are willing to work diligently.</p>\n<p>He also served as the chair of the chemistry department from 1985 to 1994 and is the former chair of the Academic Senate. He was also one of the first professors to teach students in the College of Creative Studies when it formed in 1967.</p>\n<p>A love of UCSB runs in the family, as Kirtman’s wife also worked for the university as the director of publications for the <em>Nexus</em>. The couple will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary in December.</p>\n<p>While his two children live on the East Coast, Kirtman said he loves the UC and California and does not have plans to leave anytime soon.</p>\n<p>“You don’t leave unless there’s good reason to leave,” he said. “Santa Barbara is a great place to live and work with very good faculty and students. So, why leave?”</p>\n<p>Kirtman dedicated his life to academics and said working and being a part of a university has been extremely rewarding. As the school year begins, Kirtman advises all students to take advantage of UCSB’s unique classes and academic opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Have fun. It’s a great time of life and you have no responsibilities,” Kirtman said enthusiastically, with perhaps a touch of nostalgia in his eyes. “Take everything that’s offered and pursue all your interests.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78876\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78876\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/oldest-ucsb-prof-taught-through-vietnam-civil-rights-movement/","id":2361,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2360,2359,2358],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
