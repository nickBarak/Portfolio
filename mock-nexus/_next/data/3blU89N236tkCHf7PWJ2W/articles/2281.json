The student was running as an executive candidate in the spring A.S. election, according to the email.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> began to investigate the matter immediately but was unable to confirm which candidate the anonymous sender referred to.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Nexus</em> published its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/mayela-morales-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsement of Morales</a>, the editorial board began to receive other complaints about organizational conflicts during the student lobby visits. These complaints were from three anonymous sources that worked with Morales in preparation for these conferences.</p>\n<p>Morales was the internal director of Lobby Corps as well as a member of USSA, which organized both lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> editorial board was aware of complaints against an executive candidate prior to writing the endorsement, we needed confirmation through evidence and documentation to retract our choice. Our endorsement of Morales was based on an extensive interview process and a discussion with the editorial board.</p>\n<p>Based on Morales’s interview and other involvement on campus, we do believe Morales is the right person for the position; however, our investigation into the lobbying trip conflicts has led us to retract our endorsement.</p>\n<p>According to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>, Morales failed to communicate with a colleague about transportation to the Sacramento lobby visit. The failure to communicate with the colleague in a timely manner resulted in a failure to organize the transportation.</p>\n<p>Further documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday, April 24, revealed Morales’s failure to complete the tasks she volunteered to do for a Washington, D.C. lobby visit, resulting in the untimely scheduling of flights and hotel accommodations.</p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the beginning of planning the conference, I informed the EVPSA that I was having problems with my phone because it had been in repairs for a minute. As I couldn’t afford to buy a new phone, I told everyone involved in planning the conference that I would be providing my support during my individual meetings with them, rather than over text,” </span>Morales told the <em>Nexus</em> in a statement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the beginning of 2018, due to some family financial issues, I haven’t had phone service which has made communication, at times, impossible. This is something every person I work with has been aware of since the beginning,” Morales added in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As colleagues and friends, the other people involved in the planning of the trips were aware of some of the mental health related issues I was personally going through at the time,” Morales also said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The editorial board believes it is best to formally retract the endorsement of Mayela Morales for the executive position. We apologize for our endorsement in light of this new information.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from Morales regarding her communication while organizing the lobby visits.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-83140\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>When Batsheva Labowe-Stoll was elected external vice president for local affairs, her platform included issues regarding student rights, landlord issues, creating a community court and instituting a new parking system.</p>\n<p>While some of these plans fell through, Labowe-Stoll was able to implement other projects and focus her time on being a liason for UC Santa Barbara in Isla Vista and within the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she had to put many projects on hold due to “day-to-day” issues in I.V. that frequently arose and required a majority of her attention.</p>\n<p>“I had planned out a very different year than what had happened, and it’s because I represent students to a living, breathing local community and it’s hard to plan when it comes to that, especially in a community so vibrant and alive as Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she was most proud of the Pause campaign and the Pause. town hall that occured at the beginning of winter quarter.</p>\n<p>The campaign focused on encouraging students to abstain from drug abuse during stressful times and to instead “pause” and try to understand their own mental health as well as their peers, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>She is hoping to implement the ideas brought up at the town hall and has already begun that process by working with UCSB Student Affairs and the Vice Chancellor’s office.</p>\n<p>“I spent a lot of time working on student well-being and mental health just because of the fires and mudslides,” Labowe-Stoll said. “That took up a lot of my year, in terms of trying to inform the faculty and staff at UCSB about why it was so difficult for us to go through winter quarter and deal with all of this on top of just the stresses of being a normal student.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also created Adulting 101, a series of classes offered through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office which are meant to supplement the academic curriculum students are enrolled in.</p>\n<p>The classes are meant to teach students important life skills about what it means to be an adult in the “real world.”</p>\n<p>The first class was held in February and focused on ways to reduce energy bills in order to save money and help with financial situations.</p>\n<p>The next class will take place in June and will inform dog owners about vaccinations, training and dog-care basics, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll hopes that the Adulting 101 program will continue into next year.</p>\n<p>She explained that all of her projects have been funded through funds allocated to her office. A large portion of those funds went toward a project that plans to distribute guides to the community that contain information about various resources in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We are distributing guides that have all the resources in Isla Vista, everything from the Pardall office hours to dispatch numbers for the Isla Vista foot patrol, to all 5,000 doors in Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>The guides have been made and are in the process of being paid for, according to Labowe-Stoll. She said the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) and the Finance and Business Committee are also funding the project.</p>\n<p>The guides will be distributed at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said the project was meant to be executed during Fall Quarter 2017, but was postponed due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a>. The project was again postponed during the Montecito mudslides in Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>The project was postponed an additional time at the beginning of this quarter as a result of the  the A.S. election season and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\">Measure R</a> efforts, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she represented students by attending meetings held by organizations such as Isla Vista Safe, which are chaired by the district attorney of Santa Barbara County and occur once per quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Labowe-Stoll, she also consistently attended Isla Vista Community Network meetings that occur once per month, along with Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) meetings that occur once every two weeks.</p>\n<p>“I pride myself in being the voice of the students. I think EVPLAs have chosen to take on different aspects of their position, but that’s one that I really take pride in,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p><em>Nexus </em>reporters, who attend almost every CSD meeting, reported seeing Labowe-Stoll on an occasional basis.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus, </em>Labowe-Stoll also reflected on Deltopia, which she believes was a success.</p>\n<p>“I think that UCIV and the volunteer base that they’ve cultivated has really helped the process, and I think that being able to help UCIV and the Public Safety Commission with resources and my time has really been valuable to me and to them, too,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>“I take a lot of pride in the fact that we’ve been able to really make Deltopia into a much more positive and safe environment,” she added. “From my perspective, I think it was definitely a win.”</p>\n<p>While citation and arrest numbers dropped this year at Deltopia, the number of medical transports <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/\">increased. </a></p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also said she has been involved with the Measure R campaign and strongly encourages everyone in her office to volunteer their time through canvassing.</p>\n<p>“A.S. takes a very different role in this in the sense that we can’t outright advocate for or against it because of the constraints that we have, but I try to educate people as much as I can,” Labowe-Stoll said. “Obviously I want Measure R to pass very much, I think that it is kind of the final step in the CSD to be able to have this funding to distribute back to the community.”</p>\n<p>She also provided details as to why certain aspects of her platform were not completed.</p>\n<p>Her platform included creating a “Rate My Landlord” website, which would have allowed students to rank and comment on landlords in Isla Vista. She later discovered that there were legal issues regarding students commenting freely on their landlords, as it could lead to lawsuits based on slander.</p>\n<p>She also wanted to create a community court, which would have been an I.V. based program that allowed students charged with minor misdemeanors to deal with officials in I.V. instead of being sent to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll was unable to complete the project and said she “realized how big it was” and how much legal attention it required as she began to speak to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>“This was something that I was going to work with Joan Hartmann on. We connected on it a lot at the beginning of the year and I think she got busy and it also kind of fell through,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Another one of Labowe-Stoll’s goals was to institute a parking system where specific parking spots in I.V. could be identified along sidewalks, which would ensure more parking places, but said the project would be postponed until Measure R comes to a vote.</p>\n<p>“[Parking] is a CSD power, and it involves a lot of time and money in terms of running surveys and that kind of stuff,” Labowe-Stoll said. “When I started working on it in the beginning, they [the CSD] said ‘We want to work on it too, obviously it’s our power, but we don’t have any money, so let’s wait for the tax to pass,’ so it pretty much depends on the [Measure R] tax.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll’s platform also included having Hartmann hold regular office hours in Isla Vista, which was successful.

Loudon is running with Campus United and Morales with the Isla Vista Party, both of which push for mostly progressive political ideals.</p>\n<p>The External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) serves as the official Associated Students representative of student engagement at state and national levels. In past years, the EVPSA has been the focal point of organizing student lobbying trips and making statements to the community about local, state and national political issues.</p>\n<p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS:</strong></p>\n<p>Loudon, a second-year history of public policy major, spoke about fighting with state legislators for better higher education funding and mentioned food insecurity as one of her largest concerns. She referred to her experience as the co-chair of Lobby Corps and her time served working as a policy analyst for the current EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>“As someone who’s first worked in politics and focused on legislation, I’ve found the office to be a really easy home to have here at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Morales, a fourth-year global studies and Chicanx studies major, spoke to the same ideas, adding that funding for public education should extend to all grade levels and not just the university level. She spoke to her own experience lobbying and her credentials as a lead organizer for the Student Activist Network.</p>\n<p>Morales’ relationships with public officials like Assemblywoman Monique Limón, she said, make her qualified to work with politicians to alleviate problems like student food insecurity. She spent time lobbying for bills, including one that would make it possible for students to receive the Cal Grant during summer sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>FIRST ACTION IN OFFICE:</strong></p>\n<p>Securing “state investment” would be Loudon’s top priority if elected. That doesn’t apply to simply fighting tuition hikes, she said, but rather getting the State of California to invest in all issues affecting students. She mentioned her own connections to local politicians, including State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson of Santa Barbara, as a route to getting UCSB students to the state government’s ear.</p>\n<p>In March, the UC Regents approved a 3.5 percent tuition hike for nonresident students. Morales attended the meeting where the decision was laid down, she said, and was confronted by a police officer while protesting peacefully.</p>\n<p>Loudon noted voter registration as another top priority of hers. She’s worked on getting students from “across the UC system” registered to vote. Strengthening programs like the United States Students Association would be crucial to making sure students stay active and represented in politics, she said.</p>\n<p><strong>ON-CAMPUS EFFORTS:</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>After working personally with the past two EVPSA offices, Loudon said she wants to increase education surrounding mental health — not just regarding the problem itself, but how students can utilize existing resources to improve their own circumstances.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot of work focused on expanding resources, which is very necessary,” Loudon said. “But I’ve had so many conversations with students on our campus who aren’t aware of existing programs that already benefit them from the federal government.”</p>\n<p>Morales hasn’t worked directly in the EVPSA office, but said she has high praise for it.</p>\n<p>“I fell in love with the EVPSA office two or three years ago when Moshin [Mirza] was in office,” she said. “He was able to incorporate lobbying and organizing tactics into the office.”</p>\n<p>If she’s elected, she said, she would bring those efforts back. In addition, she wants to add an office liaison to communicate with labor workers on campus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

sundown.</p>\n<p>The dining commons will give students the option of taking a maximum of two meals out of the dining commons per meal period. They will be given one three-compartment takeout box and one cup with a lid.</p>\n<p>Those who choose to take two meals will be given two boxes. “We wanted flexibility for people,” said Jill Horst, dining director of Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises.</p>\n<p>Horst said that setting the two-box limit took into consideration that many students may not have the space or resources to store large amounts of food.</p>\n<p>The program has been ongoing for several years, according to Horst.</p>\n<p>Since Ramadan begins at different times each year, the holiday had fallen on summer in some years, so the university did not always need to make any accommodations.</p>\n<p>Portola, De La Guerra and Carrillo dining commons will all offer the service.</p>\n<p>Horst said her staff chose those three dining commons because they are open seven days a week and span all geographical areas of campus.</p>\n<p>Ramadan is one of few holidays for which the university provides special accommodations.</p>\n<p>“During Passover we have a Passover table, but other than that I feel that we’re able to meet the needs of our student population through our regular service,” Horst said.</p>\n<p>Those fasting have been asked to provide their names prior to the start of the program.</p>\n<p>Horst said this is so they can prepare for the amount of students who will need the compartment boxes.</p>\n<p>The number of students using this program ranges from 10 to 20, Horst said.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday evening, she has received three requests for the accommodation, and she anticipates more students will contact her.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.5 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
