To open the month of October, it welcomed a band of 21 NBA players. The Memphis Grizzlies kicked off the 2015-2016 season holding their six-day training camp at Robertson Gymnasium in UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Hosting last year’s camp at RIMAC Arena in UC San Diego, it was only fitting that Head Coach Dave Joerger and his team headed west for another Cali training session, this time to the warm parts of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>When asked why California is such an ideal place to train for the Grizzlies, 10-year veteran Beno Udrih said, “After a hard day of practice, it’s always nice to get outside and enjoy this quality weather. We had a really great experience down in San Diego [last year], and now we have another opportunity here in Santa Barbara.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Grizzlies’ preseason at UCSD appeared to pay off in league play as they finished the year racking up 55 wins and 27 losses, the second best record in franchise history. Memphis took second place in its Southwest Division as a result, solidifying a fifth-place seed in the Western Conference Playoffs.</p>\n<p>After a promising first round win over Portland in April, crushing the Trailblazers four games to one, Memphis fell short of its NBA Finals hopes, losing a 4-2 second round series to the reigning NBA champs, the Golden State Warriors.</p>\n<p>Last year wasn’t the first time the Grizzlies had a Finals appearance stolen from them. During its 2012-13 campaign, Memphis suffered a four-game sweep in the Conference Finals to the San Antonio Spurs. The Grizzlies arguably had their best season that year, putting up a franchise-record of 56-26 and having the Defensive Player of the Year in center Marc Gasol.</p>\n<p>Coach Joerger and his crew have had their chances but have not been able to capitalize. While a crucial facial fracture to team captain Mike Conley might have hindered the team’s quest for a ring last year, the Grizzlies leave this matter behind and continue to focus on one common goal: playing in June.<br>\nUdrih believes the key in getting over this tough playoff hump starts from within.</p>\n<p>“We need to keep believing we can do it,” Udrih said. “We hit a losing streak last year in March then [played] good basketball during the playoffs but got crossed with the best team in Golden State … if we trust in [ourselves] and work hard, anything is possible in this league.”</p>\n<p>After a couple pit stops around the NBA the two-time champion has made his home here in Memphis. Udrih had one of his best seasons last year adding point guard leadership behind Conley and offensive production for a young Grizzly second-string rotation. The vet from Slovenia finished second in bench, scoring averaging 7.7 points per game right behind mid-season acquisition and former Boston Celtic Jeff Green.</p>\n<p>While it has been an uphill battle for Udrih spending the majority of his years with Sacramento, he has no doubt that his time in Memphis will be a promising one.</p>\n<p>“I spent four years in Sacramento and they weren’t very good team-wise,” Udrih said. “I bounced around a little bit but now I’m here in Memphis and I feel appreciated for what my game is on and off the court. It’s great and hopefully I can finish my career here.”</p>\n<p>Along with Udrih and Green holding the front for the second team, the Grizzlies have added a nice mixture of youth and experience to their roster. Memphis signed rim protectors Brandan Wright and Ryan Hollins as well as combo-guard Matt Barnes this offseason. The three veterans will have a tremendous impact off the bench especially later on in the postseason.</p>\n<p>On top of this Memphis has seen good production from young guys like JaMychal Green, Russ Smith and Jordan Adams. All three were elite scorers for their respective college teams (Alabama, Lousville and UCLA) and can have breakout performances at any moment.</p>\n<p>With one of the best starting lineups in the league, a healthy Mike Conley back and a bolstered bench full of vets and youths, it seems like the Grizzlies are in good shape for a playoff run this year. The question is: How far will they go?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of October 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65405\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/grizzlies-travel-cross-country-to-train-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65405\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/grizzlies-travel-cross-country-to-train-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/grizzlies-travel-cross-country-to-train-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/grizzlies-travel-cross-country-to-train-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/grizzlies-travel-cross-country-to-train-at-ucsb/","id":1988,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1987,1986,1985],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton","biography":"Not available","articles":[324,325,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,339,344,346,348,352,367,371,1387,1459,1460,1461,1466,1479,1480,1484,1488,1489,1499,1500,1503,1505,1506,1513,1524,1528,1529,1900,1959,1962,1976,1983,1988,1990,1995,3260,3281,3282,3303,3307,3324,3359],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Fantasy Sports Island: NFL Week 6","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/fantasy-football.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/fantasy-football.jpg?resize=980%2C548&ssl=1","description":"Whether if you're looking to add or remove a couple of players from your fantasy football lineup, the Fantasy Sports Island is here to provide you with some insight on the rising and declining players...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With another great week of football in the books, I welcome you all back to Fantasy Sports Island and hope that all of your teams are doing as well as they can. I myself have completely messed up with my teams this year and by that, I do not mean my teams aren’t successful; I just have a few too many. Every week I end up playing against players that I have in other leagues and I’m forced to root both for and against them. It’s a tough split, but I only have myself to blame. Luckily, in my four leagues I went 3-1 this week, only taking a loss in the league where I was on the bad end of a bye week spree. Now AP, Cam and Brandon Marshall are back and I’m ready to put my bye week woes behind me.

If you watch sports television or at least highlights, you already know about this man who is emerging as a top target for Drew Brees in this pass-happy offense. Twelve receptions for 230 yards over the last two weeks, and the only visible bright spot is when his team got blown out by the Eagles at home this past Sunday. He led all receivers with 141-yards and notched a 59-yard reception on that day alone. This man is not familiar with finding the end zone much, but his yards may be able to make up for it and in PPR leagues he will bring even more to the scoreboard. He has caught the ball no less than five times a game since week 2. Could be a savior in deeper leagues if he continues, and for those 10 and under, he still could be a great bye week cop-out, injury replacement or flex option. He has a favorable matchup today versus Atlanta.</p>\n<p>Gary Barnidge, TE Browns (37.7 percent)</p>\n<p>I already gave this guy a fair shout-out above with his play that should have been in the Lucky Top-Ten and not the actual Top-Ten. I also have to give credit to a friend of mine that pointed out his consistent success over the last three weeks. Over those three games in standard non-PPR leagues he has averaged 17 fantasy points, 107 yards and a TD. The thing I love about this guy is he is not just some redzone specialist that just gets used to cap off a good drive like we saw above. Instead he is one of McCown’s favorite targets to help get the ball down field. He and his QB have hooked up for multiple 25-yard plus gains this season making him a threat on any given play. The only shaky part of owning Barnidge is probably McCown himself, who doubtfully will continue to play like he did this past week. If you are like me and are stuck with the low production of a TE like Owen Daniels, this is the guy for you despite the risk from his QB.</p>\n<p>Knile Davis (23.7 percent) and Charcandrick West, RB’s Chiefs (1.2 percent)</p>\n<p>Now the obvious reason for this section is the fact that, as I predict every year, Jamaal Charles is out for the season again. Even the Chiefs were ready for this, having Knile ready to go should this come up again this year, and now it has. The only trouble now is: Will Knile be the number one? Or will West, who had more touches and yards last week, take over? The answer is simple: They will split the time. The only difference is that West has been much more fruitful as of late, which at this point gives him more value heading forward. Davis has only received two touches in the last three games, but that is bound to change being that he has filled in with Charles out before. It’s nearly too soon to tell as history would promote Knile, but recent weeks say West. My gut says go with Knile despite the last couple games, but both should be valuable players to have on the bench for now.<br>\nColin Kaepernick, QB 49ers (44 percent)</p>\n<p>Hey, I bet you guys all know this name, right?! Yeah, he’s that young guy who everyone thought was the next big thing since he’s mobile and went to a Super Bowl early in his career. No, not Russell Wilson — he actually won one! I’m talking about the guy who has decided to try to grow his hair like Wilson in hopes he’ll make it to a second Bowl, along with a J. Cole beard, maybe to help him actually “Work Out” in his team’s offense.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1928519421\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65412\"><img data-attachment-id=\"65413\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/fantasy-sports-island-nfl-week-6/colin-kaepernick-mr-porter-2015-photo-shoot-006/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg?fit=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,675\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-65413 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg?resize=465%2C261\" alt=\"Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006\" width=\"465\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick-Mr-Porter-2015-Photo-Shoot-006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>Okay, as much as I think he is a sub-par NFL quarterback, he actually does present some value Fantasy-wise, especially with the run game. He isn’t doing anything spectacular, but he has been pretty consistent, minus one game where Arizona tore him apart. Outside of that game, he has 4 passing TD’s and just one pick to go along with a rushing TD and a ton of yards. I can talk trash all day on this guy and the way he runs like an ostrich escaping poachers, but he actually is worth being on your roster, especially when he gets his Super Bowl redemption game this week against Baltimore. The Ravens are not fans of QBs of this type, or really any type, as they just got wrecked by Josh McCown. I like Kaep this week over most QBs.</p>\n<p><strong>Sit and Start</strong></p>\n<p>Josh McCown, QB Browns (Sit)</p>\n<p>I’ll admit that McCown has already exceeded my expectations this year. Even the Browns have, just by having two wins in five weeks, but this week will be different for the dog pound. This week they play the undefeated Denver Broncos, whose defense has not been very nice to QBs so far this season. Out of the five passers they have seen, they have forced three of them (Flacco, A. Smith, Stafford) to throw multiple interceptions in their matchup. The only guy they didn’t pick off somehow was Teddy Bridgewater, but they did sack him an outstanding seven times. With an average of 16 PA, nearly 3 TOs and 4.4 sacks a game, this one isn’t even about McCown. He should sit solely because this defense is insane and it has already stopped much better offenses than the Brown’s have.</p>\n<p>Marshawn Lynch, RB Seahawks (Start)</p>\n<p>Sat out this past week mainly for precautionary measures and is back in pads this Sunday against the undefeated Panthers. Carolina has been absolutely demolished by the run game so far this season after their defensive POY, Luke Kuechly, went down with a concussion. Although he is cleared to play this week, he won’t be up to speed and he is just one man. Marshawn Lynch on the other hand is more than a man as we have seen in recent years. On top of Marshawn being a Beast, the O-Line of the Seahawks was good enough to get Thomas Rawls 169 yards last week, so I can only imagine what the starter will do back in his regular spot. Marshawn goes in the lineup this week.</p>\n<p>T.J. Yeldon, RB Jags (Start)</p>\n<p>Oh yes, the NFL’s sole every-down back gets some spotlight from me this week, especially when Jacksonville plays Houston this Sunday. The only word that matters in this week’s matchup is “Frequency” and that is something that T.J. has on this team. The fewest carries he has gotten all year is 11, and that came last week when he exited the game early with a groin injury. Don’t let the injury scare you, he said it was nothing serious, and in this position the Jags will need him every game. I’d say at most just keep an eye out and unless he becomes “Doubtful” you want him in your lineup. Houston has struggled this year in all facets, especially stopping the run game. On another note, Yeldon could be good trade bait at this very moment in time. Always sell high!</p>\n<p>Allen Hurns, WR Jags (Start)</p>\n<p>This guy should really be included in the “Hot Off the Wire” section at just 48.6 percent owned. A teammate of the guy above that has really benefitted from having attention taken off of him thanks to Yeldon and Allen Robinson. He quietly has put up two consecutive, identical weeks of 116 yards and a touchdown thanks in part to Bortles coming into his own. With 16 receptions over those last two games, I’m hoping he can get exactly 116 more this week when the Jags play a Houston defense that we have already outed today. Plus, he can do stuff like this, which makes a QBs life very easy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTAJAk25q_A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Dion Lewis, RB Patriots (Start)</p>\n<p>This man’s run game has been so-so but in combination with his receiving game he is a perfect fantasy running back. Against a sub-par Colts team, I expect Dion to add another 12-plus point outing as he has all season so far. Anyone that Brady throws the ball to is worth being in your lineup. Throw this man in your flex and watch the numbers pile up. Those of you that have him in a PPR league, congrats.</p>\n<p>Danny Woodhead, RB Chargers (Sit)</p>\n<p>Everyone around the league is saying that this guy is a must-start and I personally must disagree! Unless you are in a PPR league, where he actually has some value, he needs to be on your bench this week. With Melvin Gordon getting all of the carries, and now starting to challenge Woodhead for receptions as well, Dan Boy’s value drops drastically. He will still get his few receptions here and there but nothing like expected early in this season. The man had two TDs in week one and hasn’t found the end zone since. It pains me to tell you to sit him, because I love the guy and his work ethic, but he won‘t help your team to a victory this week against an undefeated Green Bay team that will have possession for most of the game. I really hope he makes me eat my words, but I don’t see it happening this week. He will definitely come up short (had to get a height joke in).<br>\nThank you all once again for joining me on the Island today! I hope the insight helps you to yet another Fantasy Victory this week. This is where teams begin to pull away from each other and the real playoff picture starts to emerge. Make sure you have chance of winning your money back.</p>\n<p>As always, feel free to hit me up on Twitter for any advice or questions.

id=\"caption-attachment-89778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The food bank typically operates on the third floor of the UCen. <em>Olivia Consterdine / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The elevator, which Interim Food Bank Coordinator Philip Pinedo said needs to be fixed and “re-engineered to current building codes,” should take about six to nine months to fix. The food bank will return to its permanent location on the third floor once maintenance is completed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinedo, who took over as interim coordinator in late June, said the food bank had actually utilized its current second-floor temporary space in previous years before it moved to the third-floor location. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that there has been a positive response to the new location from the food bank’s student workers despite the fact that the new location lacks refrigerators and freezers. Pinedo explained that they were “working on getting a freezer” so the bank can offer frozen food items. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] like the location, they like the fresh and new layout, they like the view and they like the natural light in the area,” Pinedo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Pinedo’s first acts as interim manager was coordinating the food bank’s move from the third floor to the second, which took place over four days starting on Aug. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were doing an entire move in a very short period of time, and we were working in cooperation with the UCen and with students at the food bank and with student coordinators as well,” Pinedo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinedo said he hopes to make changes to the food bank while it is in its new location before it moves back to the third floor of the UCen, although he did not note any specifics. Any proposed changes also have to be discussed with the food bank’s student coordinators and student staff before any concrete plans can be made, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinedo will be working with students and student coordinators on outreach during Fall Quarter in order to make more students aware of the services that the food bank has to offer. He also plans to forge partnerships with other campus organizations that have previously expressed interest in working with the food bank, in order to reach a wider range of students who might not be aware of what the food bank has to offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Oftentimes, different departments on campus have some sort of interest in partnering with us because it will be mutually beneficial,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you look at that and the number of students we’re serving, it tells me that students are benefitting from this,” Pinedo added, referencing the food bank’s distribution numbers. During the 2017-2018 school year, the food bank distributed 39,182 pounds of food that fed 3,282 students or 13.1% of UCSB students, according to an infographic distributed by the food bank. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, students visited the food bank 52,744 times between the summer of 2017 to Spring Quarter 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basic needs, such as food insecurity, need to be at the forefront of our thinking as far as students’ well-being.

When you have Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, though, you’re great no matter what year it is.<br>\nAll the fuss about Deflategate hasn’t slowed New England down one bit, and the Tom Brady Revenge Tour is in full effect. The old man is third in QB rating, first in yards per game and has his team leading the NFL in point differential (49). Did I mention he’s a two-time MVP, three-time Super Bowl MVP and four-time champ that shows no Peyton Manning-like signs of slowing down?<br>\nThe receiving corps of Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola has gotten the job done, while solid production from shifty running back Dion Lewis has kept the Patriots offense in full throttle.

They have some issues to work out on defense, but we’ll have to wait and see if they can separate themselves from the Panthers in the only division that has two 4-0 teams.<br>\nLuckily for Atlanta, they have one of the easiest remaining schedules in the league, meaning they have a great shot at challenging Green Bay for the No. 1 seed in the NFC.</p>\n<p><strong>#5 Denver Broncos</strong><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"110977107\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65101\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64688\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/nfl/broncos/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=1280%2C744&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Broncos\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?fit=888%2C516&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-64688\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=157%2C91\" alt=\"Broncos\" width=\"157\" height=\"91\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Broncos.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><br>\nIf there’s one piece of advice 39-year-old Peyton Manning would give to Tom Brady right now, it’s this: Enjoy being 38. The decline of Mr. NFL Record Book has been excruciatingly noticeable this year yet, somehow, the Broncos are 4-0.<br>\nDenver’s defense has saved it on more than one occasion, but Peyton has gotten the job done when he’s needed to, most notably in a comeback win over the Chiefs in which he threw the game-tying touchdown with little time remaining.<br>\nStill, Peyton currently ranks 30th in the league in quarterback rating at 80.8, completing just 63.6 percent of passes while throwing a pick in all four games.<br>\nThe running game hasn’t done much to help either. C.J. Anderson doesn’t look like the game-changing force he was in the later parts of 2014, and other than a 72-yard TD scamper last week — Ronnie Hillman still has much to prove.<br>\nDefense and Manning’s legendary track record keep the Broncos in the conversation for Super Bowl contenders for now, but we’ll see how long that lasts.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2072591840\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65101\"><img data-attachment-id=\"64767\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-22/nfl-round-up-week-2-review/panthers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=1280%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,696\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"panthers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?fit=888%2C483&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-64767 alignleft\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=153%2C83\" alt=\"panthers\" width=\"153\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/panthers.png?resize=1024%2C557&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>#6 Carolina Panthers</strong><br>\nThere were two things we kept hearing about the Panthers offense coming into the season: their lack of depth at receiver and Jonathan Stewart’s new role as the lead back. The receiving corps still isn’t that good and Stewart has been disappointing to say the least, yet Cam Newton has still managed to keep his team right there alongside Atlanta atop the NFC South.<br>\nIt might just be a matter of time before the Panthers show their true colors, as it seems pretty clear Cam isn’t ready to make a deep playoff run until he’s got a little more experience and a lot more help, but for now, Carolina can bask in its exciting potential.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65101\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/nfl-round-up-week-4-cream-of-the-crop/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65101\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/nfl-round-up-week-4-cream-of-the-crop/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/nfl-round-up-week-4-cream-of-the-crop/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/nfl-round-up-week-4-cream-of-the-crop/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/nfl-round-up-week-4-cream-of-the-crop/","id":1985,"author":{"id":63,"name":"Michael Jorgenson"},"related":[1984,1983,1982],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
