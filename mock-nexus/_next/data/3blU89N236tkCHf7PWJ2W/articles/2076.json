Mr. and Mrs. Little <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\">filed a case on March 19</a> and f</span>ormer Officer Ryan Smith <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-07/former-officer-sues-ucpd-alleges-racism-misconduct-and-conspiracy-throughout-department/\">filed a case on March 27. </a></p>\n<p><b>The 2016 Internal Affairs Investigation</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit states that a complaint was filed in or around April 2016 against two former UCPD officers, Jeff Savalgio and Josh Rothermel, which alleges the two officers committed “sexual assault and the provision of alcohol to a minor [UCSB] student.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was allegedly not named in the investigation because of his “relationships with the highest levels of UCPD,” according to court documents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the end of May 2016, Lieutenant Millard allegedly “advised Savaglio and Rothermel to resign in order to avoid a potentially negative outcome” from the Internal Affairs investigation, which could have banned the two from working as police officers, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither are currently working with the UCPD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith’s alleged relationship and involvement with Savaglio, Rothermel and the student was never “investigated or even associated” in the investigation, court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges Olson openly said he wanted the investigation “to go away as quietly as possible.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other officers in the department allegedly complained about Smith and Olson’s “Good Ole Boys’ Club,” but “feared retaliation against them for voicing their concerns about the improper and possibly unlawful behavior and conduct of Smith,” court documents state. Other officers also allegedly “confided” their concerns about Smith in Signa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Signa expressed concern about the “impropriety” of favoritism in the department and was later allegedly retaliated against at a lunch in or around August 2016. Sergeant Romero “attacked Signa’s position as Patrol Lieutenant, stating that the other sergeants were upset with Signa’s leadership style and were contemplating a vote of no confidence in Signa,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the lunch, Lieutenant Signa allegedly met with each of the six sergeants, excluding Sergeants Romero and Smith, during which “none of the sergeants expressed discontent with Signa’s leadership” or the intention to “submit a vote of no confidence against Signa,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shortly after, Signa was “transferred from Patrol Lieutenant to Administrative Lieutenant,” which was seen as “punishment against Signa for not ‘falling in line’ with the ‘Good Ole Boys’ Club,’” court documents state.</span></p>\n<p><b>The 2017 Internal Affairs Investigation </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In or around September 2017, court documents state that UCPD Corporal Tiffany Little “submitted a letter of complaint alleging improper and possibly unlawful conduct by Smith.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are allegations that were included in the complaint, according to court documents:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly had “an extra-marital affair” with a subordinate UCPD officer; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith “covered up” for an automobile accident in which the subordinate officer was driving a UCPD vehicle on campus;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was involved in an alleged hit-and-run automobile accident in which he “hit a parked car” with a UCPD vehicle;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used police lights and sirens “to get through heavy traffic” in order to attend “a free breakfast,” while visiting UC Los Angeles;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith allegedly used UCPD resources to visit the subordinate officer in Santa Cruz;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiffany Little, with her husband UCPD Officer Michael Little, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\">also filed a suit against several members of the UCPD on March 29 on similar charges</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard was allegedly tasked with investigating this complaint and shared concerns with Signa “about how the IA investigation might affect his friendship with Smith,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went on leave in or around the middle of 2017 and by the end of that year received a job at the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olson, Farley and Millard allegedly said during several meetings that “having Smith get the alternate position was the easiest solution to the issues the department was facing,” court documents state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court documents allege that the “woefully inadequate” investigation was closed right before Smith left UCPD toward the end of 2017 so the investigation would “not impede his ability to get the job” at the Office of Emergency Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith was also allegedly treated to “a celebratory farewell lunch” and continued to have lunch with Olson, Millard and Romero after leaving the department. </span></p>\n<p><b>Signa’s Concerns and Alleged Retaliation: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly reported concerns about Smith and overall UCPD “propriety” to Olson and Farley. Some of Signa’s reported concerns follow: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“‘Dick jokes’” made on or about a meeting on May 21, 2017 “in front of female officers and staff”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith’s misuse of UCPD funds and resources; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Smith’s impunity and insulation from any form of disciplinary action”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excessively long supervisor meetings, sometimes two or three hours over the regular length;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Approval of expenses and travel for members of the ‘Good Ole Boys’ Club’ in or around January 17, 2017, but not for those excluded from such club.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa was allegedly retaliated against for voicing these concerns, according to court documents. The alleged retaliations included: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “key meetings” essential for Signa’s job duties; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not being able to email Olson without notifying Farley as well and receiving criticism for not adequately communicating with Olson; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bullying, harassing, publicly criticizing and blaming Signa in front of other officers and for unfounded reasons”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory meetings with Farley to “check-in,” in which “Signa received contradictory directives and conflicting information”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from UCPD social events;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Resistance” from Olson to meet in private with Signa;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusion from “leadership, promotional and learning opportunities”; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure to resign early. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>University Response</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa filed a complaint with Human Resources in or around May 2018 about “his departmental concerns and the retaliation he faced for trying to voice them.” Signa met with Cynthia Señeriz, the acting director, human resources and compensation manager at UCSB, who allegedly told Signa “she would have someone follow up with him,” court documents say. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signa allegedly went on stress leave on or around June 1, 2018. Shortly after, UCSB Employee &amp; Labor Relations Specialist Jessica Graham allegedly contacted Signa and said she would update him on the status of the complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of November 2018, Signa had not heard back from either Señeriz or Graham, according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 19, 2018, Signa submitted two whistleblower complaints to UCSB, but had not heard back as of November 2018 when he filed the lawsuit against the UC Police Department.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that more UCPD officers also submitted whistleblower complaints similar to Signa’s. It does not specify whether those are in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Little’s complaints. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the university is aware of the lawsuits filed against UCPD and “is undertaking a thorough review.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit in full can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20181121-Summons-and-Complaint-1.pdf\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [May 8, 10:54 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vigil organizers passed out small, battery-operated blue light candles, which attendees switched on as they were placed in their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Dhishal Jayasinghe was one of the first to take the stage, during which he spoke about his childhood and various identities as a “Singhalese, Buddhist, Sri Lankan, American, asylum seeker who came here at the age of three years old fleeing war.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jayasinghe described his gratefulness for the people who showed up to support the bombing victims and urged the audience members to reject the destructive ideals of nationalism and instead opt for unity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB student Shobha Ambi, who spoke after Jayasinghe, shared her “frustration and sadness” with the crowd, tearing up as she expressed her disbelief at the scale of the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any life lost is heartbreaking enough, but 253 lives is overwhelming on an entirely different level,” Ambi said. “My heart hurts for the victims whose lives were taken away so unjustly and for their families who are forced to deal with the consequences.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ambi recounted the stories of some of those who lost their lives on April 21, including that of an 11-year-old child. Ambi said she was disappointed by the lack of focus she saw on the victims of the attack, with more attention seeming to go toward the attackers and the Sri Lankan government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Does no one comprehend the death of how many lives were ripped away just four days ago? 253 lives,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She echoed sentiments similar to that of Jayasinghe, stating that one doesn’t need to be Sri Lankan to understand the tragedy suffered by the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These weren’t just the lives of Sri Lankans that were taken away. These were the lives of human beings,” Ambi said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87792\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-87792\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87792\" data-attachment-id=\"87792\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/a-vigil-goer-holding-the-led-candle-distributed-by-the-organizer/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1313&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1313\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"A vigil goer holding the LED candle distributed by the organizer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?fit=888%2C583&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87792\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=888%2C583\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=250%2C164&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Vigil_Sicheng-Wang_ONLINE_4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87792\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vigil organizers passed out blue light candles. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another UCSB student, Huda Faiz, took the stage next, expressing her love for Sri Lanka at  the beginning of her speech. Faiz said that now, many people know her home only for the tragedies that have taken place there. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Faiz, it’s something much different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sri Lanka to you is 253 lives that were lost and counting,” she said. “But Sri Lanka to me is the birds singing at the break of dawn. It’s the old man selling vegetables rolling his cart down my street calling for buyers at 6 a.m. It’s the fresh smell of morning tea and home-cooked coconut rice wafting from my aunt’s kitchen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz said the community of Sri Lanka is one that is built upon principles of love, tolerance, acceptance and resilience. For Faiz, the power of the community to unite against the forces of intolerance is something that should be seen before the tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faiz stressed the power that can be harnessed with love and community. She finished her portion with a Christian prayer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the vigil, Jayasinghe returned to the microphone to share his thanks to the organizers of the event and the attendees. Attendees then returned their candles to a table in the center, where the small blue lights shone in the shape of the number 253.</span></p>\n<p>Further photos from the vigil can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-27/in-photos-indus-pan-asian-network-hold-vigil-for-sri-lanka-victims/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

As an “alternative,” the $3.33 per quarter fee was proposed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/58384528_321304875200897_6072833742202732544_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1218723404\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87908\">“in order to continue providing night and weekend parking for students.”</a></p>\n<p>For the next five years, until around 2008, the permits were provided to students at no additional cost other than the $3.33 fee, according to Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) Director Nestor Covarrubias.</p>\n<p>But it’s 2019, and students are still paying that $3.33 per quarter fee – without the free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>For the past 11 years, students have had to pay money on top of the $3.33 per quarter fee if they want night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>The $3.33 fee is currently being used to “partially cover” the full cost of a night and weekend parking permit, which stands at $160 for community members and $52.50 for students for three quarters, Covarrubias said in an email to the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>If that fee went away, students would pay the full $160, he confirmed.</p>\n<p>It was the discovery that the initial ballot language promised students “free” night and weekend parking that prompted A.S. President Brooke Kopel to post on her personal Facebook on April 22, encouraging UCSB students to vote no on the TPS $3.33 reaffirmation fee that was on the Spring Quarter 2019 ballot.</p>\n<p>“I have attempted to re-implement this free night and weekend parking that TPS has promised us. In conversations with A.S. staff, I have discovered that over the years since this lock-in was passed, TPS claims that the $3.33 fee is just no longer enough to supplement free night and weekend parking due to their own institutional growth and expansion,” Kopel said in the post.</p>\n<p>“BUT that is not what YOU pay for. YOU pay for FREE night and weekend parking. Not subsidized night and weekend parking.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>, Kopel explained that her predecessor, former A.S. President Hieu Le, attempted to “strong arm” TPS into providing students with free night and weekend parking toward the end of his term by asking A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez not to give TPS the money collected by student fees.</p>\n<p>Once Kopel took office, she said she was told by Márquez that A.S. cannot legally withhold that money from TPS.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s ballot language that was voted on and approved by the student body that this money will be paid to TPS, even though they’re not giving exactly what the ballot language says, Marisela can’t just withhold funds that students voted on giving to a department,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really, really irresponsible of Associated Students to be letting students pay $10 a year for a service they are not receiving. $10 could be a few meals, $10 could go to rent, $10 could go to gas, to books.”</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, the fee was reaffirmed with 3901 yeses, or 71.79%, and 1533 noes, or 28.21%. It cannot be voted on again until Spring Quarter 2021.</p>\n<p>If A.S. was “open to the idea,” Covarrubias said, “TPS could come up with an updated rate to provide the undergraduate Night &amp; Weekend permit at no additional cost.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [1:15 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

How do you plan to advocate for and uplift the voices of LGBTQ students? What will you do to contribute to making UCSB a space where LGBTQ students feel safe in their communities, specifically in your college? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collegiate Senators have duties specific to their college. For example, according to Legal Code, College of L&amp;S senators are supposed to meet with one of their college deans twice every quarter and the College of Engineering Senator is supposed to serve as a chair of the College of Engineering Student Council. Those are just two of the many duties assigned to collegiate senators. How has your past experience prepared you for this future task? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think about the class sign up process on G.O.L.D.? In the past, students have recommended a shopping cart on G.O.L.D. where students could favorite classes they want to take before their pass times. Do you believe G.O.L.D. is currently a convenient way to choose your classes or could it be better?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB offers several on-campus resources that many students don’t even know about, such as the Collaborate Print Labs that offer 200 free prints a quarter. Name any on-campus resource that you believe students as a whole could learn about and perhaps take advantage of in the future. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, 13 graduate student workers reported that a man was seen walking in the hallways of the sociology department wearing a shirt with an antisemitic phrase. This incident was reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it shows that even on-campus education buildings are not immune to antisemitism. As a collegiate senator, how would you attempt to combat antisemitism and ensure that people from all backgrounds are heard, valued and respected? </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would your first line of action be if you are elected? </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responses to the issues presented by the questions, as well as candidates’ general goals, are summarized below:</span></p>\n<p><b>College of Engineering Candidates: </b></p>\n<p><b>Lim,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a first-year chemical engineering major, believes that the greatest issue facing students in the College of Engineering is the stigma regarding mental health services. He said that, if elected, he wants to promote mental health awareness and wellness campaigns. Lim added that he is currently a part of the AIChE club at UCSB, which is a chemical engineering club; through that, he has experience in communicating with professors and students within his college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also wants to make a phone app geared toward S.T.E.M. and engineering students that would compile an inventory of different resources on campus that are “available to help people with their academic studies.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Reyes Carrillo, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year computer science major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is accessibility to certain technologies. If elected, Reyes Carrillo plans to advocate for lendable laptops and 3D printers. Reyes Carrillo also said that she believes the two-party system should not exist, which is why she chose to run independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of how Reyes Carrillo would uplift the voices of LGBTQ students in her college, she mentioned the need for advocating for organizations such as oSTEM, which is an organization at UCSB aimed at promoting and supporting LGBTQ individuals in S.T.E.M. fields. Reyes Carrillo added that she believes the College of Engineering should have two senatorial seats. </span></p>\n<p><b>College of Letters and Science Candidates:</b></p>\n<p><b>Danielzadeh, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a second-year psychological and brain sciences major, said the greatest issue facing students in her college is over-enrollment. Danielzadeh wants to modify G.O.L.D. and update the waitlist system so that students with “upper standing who need certain classes to graduate on time have priority.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When meeting with the deans of the College of L&amp;S twice a quarter if elected, Danielzadeh hopes to “encourage the addition of new majors that are more fit with our current job market and what our generation is actually interested in.” Danielzadeh didn’t specify exactly which majors she would like added. She also wants to improve Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.) by offering one-on-one affordable tutoring for students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Campos, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a third-year sociology major, said the greatest issue facing students in the College of Letters &amp; Science is that the college does not have enough resources. Campos hopes to form a committee with honors students from different departments to “ensure that every student feels that their major concerns are being voiced.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Campos also wants to find a solution regarding textbook affordability by working with department heads and administrators on campus to gain funding to expand course reserves in the library.</span></p>\n<p><b>Chocron,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an undeclared second-year, also believes that awareness surrounding mental health is the biggest issue facing students in his college. Chocron mentioned his involvement in Hillel, the Public Safety Commission and the Interfraternity Council, citing his ability to work with a variety of groups at UCSB and in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the recent instances of antisemitism at UCSB, Chocron said that one solution is to hold “open spaces where leaders on our campus are able to educate students on the issue and let them form their own response and come up with their own ideas as to how they feel and what they should do.” He Chocron then emphasized that one of his biggest platform points is to ensure the safety of students and faculty at UCSB; he also said that UCSB needs to do a better job of making sure that students and faculty are aware of emergency policies.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.
