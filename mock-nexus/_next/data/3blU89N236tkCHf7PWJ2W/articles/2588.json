During the Day of Remembrance, an altar was dedicated to victims of deadly hate crimes and La Familia de Colores members read the names of all documented trans-identified persons killed since last year’s day of remembrance.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Chican@ studies and black studies double major and La Familia de Colores Organizer Abigail Salazar said Reyes was being honored for fighting for justice and equality in the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“We have a space that queer trans Latino folks can exist in within this very violent institution we are in,” Salazar said. “But we still honor all the other trans women and trans women of color who have passed away due to state violence or other forms of violence.”</p>\n<p>Salazar said she hopes people understand the “urgency” of the situation.</p>\n<p>“There’s no coincidence that there’s such a long list of … trans women of color murders,” Salazar said. “We have to be conscious of that and learn how to be allies in order to really help our trans brothers and sisters to create change.”</p>\n<p>According to La Familia de Colores member and fourth-year black studies and feminist studies double major Ernie Piña, there are dozens of transgender deaths that go unreported each year.</p>\n<p>“This past year, I worked in conjunction with organizing on behalf of Jesse Hernandez … while I continued and continued to look for research on Jesse Hernandez, there was nothing that was reported,” Piña said. “There’s all these trans folks that are passing, but they’re not shown or given the opportunity to visibility that other people would have.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and global studies double major Kasey Rubio said the event should be more of a priority to the whole community.</p>\n<p>“Many women have been taken from us; I think everyone should be here to pay their respect,” Rubio said. “These are our fallen trans brothers and sisters. A lot of them we’ll never even know because most of them don’t get documented.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major and La Familia de Colores Board Member Emmanuel Suarez-Jimenez, society continues to struggle with the changing norms and perceptions surrounding sexual identities and lifestyles.</p>\n<p>“We live in a really transphobic society that really doesn’t know how to deal with new ideas, new concepts, new theories of how people want to live their way,” Suarez-Jimenez said. “I think that’s one thing we all need to really understand, is that we all have our own identities, we all pick them.”</p>\n<p>Piña said problems with sexual and gender identities persist because people cannot accept differences.</p>\n<p>“Our society in general doesn’t accept trans bodies because they’re deviant from the norm. In terms of trans bodies, in terms of what gender is — is just seen as abstract or weird,” Piña said. “That’s where hate comes from, that’s where a lot of what drives them from being is that people don’t understand.”</p>\n<p>Piña said many people do not comprehend the physical transitions of many transgender people.</p>\n<p>“Folks don’t understand — imagine living in this body or this existence where you don’t feel comfortable with the way you express your gender or you don’t feel comfortable in the way you are,” Piña said. “That’s what trans folks do; they make themselves so they can feel comfortable in their bodies.”</p>\n<p>Suarez-Jimenez said individual activists have been instrumental in challenging societal norms, such as Marsha P. Johnson who is credited for being one of the first people to incite the Stonewall riots of 1969 in New York.</p>\n<p>“She’s a trans woman of color who threw the first stone, who started that police riot,” Suarez-Jimenez said. “She’s who finally started that momentum rolling on the fact that we really need to acknowledge that there are different identities and we need to accept them and we need to challenge ourselves to be more accepting.”</p>\n<p>Rubio said the Transgender Day of Remembrance provided an atmosphere to honor lost lives and focus on preventing future tragedies.</p>\n<p>“This type of event is just a beautiful space to grieve and to mourn, but also to reflect and look to the future and think about what we want to change and how we’re going to do that, so that we don’t have to continuously be holding these spaces for those that have been murdered,” Rubio said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66714\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66714\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-23/transgender-day-of-remembrance-commemorates-lives-lost-to-violence/","id":2588,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2587,2586,2585],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza","biography":"Not available","articles":[2518,2535,2587,2588,2609,3607,3866,4586,4614,4624],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"University, Police, Attorney Respond to Rape Arrest","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Location.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Location.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The University of California, Santa Barbara responded Thursday to the arrest of a suspect in the February 2014 rape and assault of a student on campus.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The University of California, Santa Barbara responded Thursday to the arrest of a suspect in the February 2014 rape and assault of a student on campus.</p>\n<p>Daniel J.

Rob Romero said Chen was arrested in Alameda County on an unrelated felony drug charge, during which authorities swabbed the inside of his mouth for DNA, ultimately leading to the rape charges.</p>\n<p>When police in Alameda County ran Chen’s DNA through an FBI database, it matched evidence found at the UCSB crime scene. Chen was transferred to Santa Barbara County Jail on Wednesday, about a week after university police learned of the DNA match, Romero said.</p>\n<p>The victim filed a personal injury <strong><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a></strong> in January alleging, among other claims, that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the case.</p>\n<p>Tyrone Maho, one of two attorneys representing the victim, said Thursday that his client was “relieved” to hear about the arrest.</p>\n<p>“Our client was really pleased that this developed,” Maho said. “I’m just hoping it leads to the location and the prosecution of any other assailants involved.”</p>\n<p>Romero said that while the DNA match was a lucky break, UCPD has continued to investigate the case since 2014.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we were fortunate from the DNA hit, but we were never not motivated to solve this case,” Romero said Thursday. “We do know there’s a lawsuit out there but we’ve just been grinding and chipping away at this case.”</p>\n<p>In its statement, UCSB said, “We deeply appreciate the multiagency search that led to the uncovering and collection of DNA evidence, which has now resulted in the arrest of a suspect. This is a crucial step toward achieving justice and preventing future tragedies.”</p>\n<p>The university said that while the arrest is a step forward, “it may bring renewed pain to our student and her family.”</p>\n<p>“We keep them in our thoughts, as we have for the past two years, and we continue to offer our unwavering support and heartfelt sympathy.”</p>\n<p>Chen is currently being held without bail in Santa Barbara County Jail. He will be arraigned Feb. 16 in Santa Barbara Superior Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Students will host a “Latinx Town Hall” Monday at 7 p.m. in the Graduate Student Association lounge at the MultiCultural Center to create a safe space for the Latino/a community.</p>\n<p>The town hall is a closed event open only to those who “identify with the Latinx community,” according to the Facebook event page, so that students feel comfortable discussing issues such as policing, safety and accessing resources. UCSB was named by the Hispanic Association of Colleges &amp; Universities in January as a Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI) after reaching 25 percent Hispanic enrollment in undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Student Advocate General and fourth-year global studies and art double major Joseline Garcia, who is organizing the event along with Lorena Alvarez and Cassie Rubio, said the town hall will provide a space for students to voice their struggles and find ways to address them.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the town hall is to create a space where individuals who identify with the Latinx community can discuss issues that are pertinent to them,” Garcia said in an email. “Those issues can range from constant racial profiling, insufficient resources, displacement of Latinx families in I.V., etc.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said UCSB being an HSI does not necessarily mean Latino/a students are sufficiently represented on campus.</p>\n<p>“The number doesn’t show the retention percentage of the Latinx that are able to graduate,” Garcia said in an email. “It’s very rare to see a Latinx professor and graduate students on campus. This alone is one of the many reasons the town hall is essential. It is important to spark common conversation pertaining to how we want to be represented as a student body on campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said Latino/a students face discrimination that surfaces in many ways which are not “isolated” from one another.</p>\n<p>“It is important that all individuals understand that the terror faced by the 43 students in Ayotzinapa about a year ago, the racist remarks made by presidential candidates, the criminalization of brown bodies, inaccessibility of higher education to undocumented students, the cultural appropriation of Latinx culture in Halloween … are all interconnected,” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year Chican@ studies major Mara Tinajero said safe spaces allow students to connect with their community.</p>\n<p>“Classes like Chicano studies, spaces like El Congreso and spaces for people of color is something our campus needs to pay more attention to and possibly get more funding [for],” Tinajero said. “Those spaces are crucial because our students go to those and feel at home.”</p>\n<p>Tinajero said she thinks Latino/a students are represented better at UCSB than on most campuses, but there is still progress to be made.</p>\n<p>“I definitely feel that we have more representation on our campus than others because we are a Hispanic-serving institute,” Tinajero said. “I feel like our voices are heard louder than others, but I feel like it’s not enough. I feel like our voices need to be heard even more.”</p>\n<p>Tinajero said her experience attending this year’s Students of Color Conference at UC Berkeley allowed her to connect and draw strength from others in her community.</p>\n<p>“It was really comforting to see that some of the struggles I’ve been through, I haven’t been through them alone,” Tinajero said. “Seeing how people took those experiences and push through and triumphed helps.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Cultivating Racial Consciousness &amp; Inclusivity” on Thursday, where panelists discussed racial tensions on university campuses across the country.</p>\n<p>Recent racially charged incidents — such as those at University of Missouri, Yale, UCLA, University of Michigan, University of Oklahoma and Harvard University – are raising the question of how UCSB staff and faculty can better serve as allies to students of color. Four panelists at the event, Lisa Slavid, Diane Fujino, Aaron Jones and Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, spoke about why U.S. campuses are experiencing racial tensions, how racial consciousness manifests itself on college campuses, how to speak on race in a classroom and freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>Professor of Asian American studies Diane Fujino said while the Civil Rights Movement eliminated formal discrimination, it was “insufficient” at combatting all race issues.</p>\n<p>“Racism has changed,” Fujino said. “The work in the ’50s was to legitimate that racism existed and it was wrong, but today, there is more knowledge that racism is wrong, and the work today is really to prove that it still exists.”</p>\n<p>Graduate Student Association President Aaron Jones said racism is still present in everyday society.</p>\n<p>“It is in all things,” Jones said. “If you’re a fish in water, you can’t see the water, doesn’t mean you’re not in the water. We’re living in it, we’re breathing in it. It’s in our society, so of course, it’s going to be manifested on a college campus.”</p>\n<p>Coordinator of organizational and performance management for Housing and Residential Services at UCSB Lisa Slavid said she is not surprised to see racial consciousness manifest on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“Really, where else in the country would they manifest?” Slavid asked. “Colleges are part of the institutions of the country, and these conversations need to happen. They won’t be happening in the companies or corporations of Google or Facebook or J.C. Penny, they will be emerging here.”</p>\n<p>Jones said college campuses should be safe, educational spaces for discussing racial issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re supposed to be able to engage in these kinds of dialogues. If we can’t have those types of dialogues and conversations in a university, then we’re in really bad shape,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Associate professor of Chican@ studies Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval said such conversations should not be limited to certain majors.</p>\n<p>“Even in Chicano studies, we feel like we need to talk about Black Lives Matter,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “We don’t think that this is something that should be in one department, in one discipline. We need to talk about Black Lives Matter in our own department, in our own community.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster-Sandoval said people need to discuss their different views and opinions to begin a dialogue.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people have a problem with the name ‘Black Lives Matter,’ and that’s okay, but we need to talk about this,” Armbruster-Sandoval said. “How are we going to work this through otherwise? It’s not easy to have a conversation about these things — it’s a very difficult thing to walk through, but I don’t think it was fair for people not to talk about it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66697\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"251323568\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66709\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66697\" data-attachment-id=\"66697\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-20/regents-form-group-to-protect-students-from-intolerance/intolerance_by-vivian-bui-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447936053\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Consciousness/Calling In\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66697 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Intolerance_by-Vivian-Bui-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66697\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Slavid said conversations about racial issues may be difficult because of fear.</p>\n<p>“There’s a silence, and it’s mostly because people are afraid,” Slavid said. “They’re afraid to say the wrong thing.”</p>\n<p>Fujino said these conversations can be difficult to approach in a class setting, but faculty and staff must work to appropriately address the issues.</p>\n<p>“For professors, it’s trial and error and if we’re dedicated, we talk to colleagues to figure it out,” Fujino said. “There is increasing attention to issues of what they call ‘diversity,’ that means it’s built instructionally. The faculty need to create a space in classrooms so that people can speak, and I also think what it takes is to evaluate and listen to each other.”</p>\n<p>According to Slavid, faculty and staff can be allies at UCSB by trusting and listening to students’ perspectives.</p>\n<p>“As a white ally, recognize that people of color’s lived experiences are different than yours,” Slavid said. “Show up, listen to learn, but also know when to speak as an ally, even if it makes you nervous, because our silence on topics of racial injustice is part of the issue.”</p>\n<p>Associate Director of LGBT Services in the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity Klint Jaramillo said he knows students with questions about racial issues want to have conversations.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can move forward and make spaces like this for faculty and staff so we can not only support each other, but support our students,” Jaramillo said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66709\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66709\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-22/ucsb-minority-associations-host-discussion-on-nationwide-racial-tensions/","id":2587,"author":{"id":125,"name":"Dahyana Barraza"},"related":[2586,2585,2584],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
