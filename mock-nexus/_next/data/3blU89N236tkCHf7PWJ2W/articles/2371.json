Senate voted against the divestment resolution, 0-16. Seven abstained. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Many Jewish students who spoke at the public comment portion called the resolution anti-Semitic, saying that divestment from the nation state of Israel personally affects Jewish students on campus.</p>\n<p>Nate Erez, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the resolution presents an anti-Semitic rhetoric and is a “denial of the Jewish right to self-determination.”</p>\n<p>“This language is no more than a clever disguise to achieve a much more sinister agenda,” Erez said during public forum. “This is a direct attack on the one Jewish state in the world.”</p>\n<p>Danielle Cohen, fourth-year sociology and film double major, said the BDS and SJP movements have presented a “misleading portrayal” of the Israel-Palestine conflict and have normalized anti-Semitism on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“I have never felt so unsafe and unwelcome on campus than I do during the BDS campaign,” Cohen said.</p>\n<p>Other students reject the argument that divestment from Israel is an attack on religious or ethnic Jews.They defend the resolution saying that divestment maintains the UC’s neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus.”</p>\n<p>— Aaron Hendizadeh</p></blockquote>\n<p>Menelik Dagnachew, a third-year English major, said he supports divestment as an Ethiopian American because he believes the oppression of Palestinians is similar to the oppression of Ethiopian people.</p>\n<p>“My heart bleeds for Palestinian people,” he said. “It makes me mad so that I’m shaking right now. As much as this is a cultural issue … this is not an issue we should be directly tied to.”</p>\n<p>Cameron Klein, a second-year history major and Jewish student, spoke in favor of the resolution and objected to the alleged victimization of the Jewish ethnic minority.</p>\n<p>“Just because you’re a minority does not give you the right to violate human rights,” he said.</p>\n<p>Michael Torbati, the chief financial officer of the A.S. Finance and Business Committee, said he is opposed to divestment because he believes the investment in the companies is beneficial for students and the university.</p>\n<p>“In terms of fiscal responsibility, these investments bring a lot back to UCSB students,” Torbati said.</p>\n<p>Other speakers at public forum in support of the resolution cited historical events, such as the United States Civil Rights movement and the South African apartheid, as similar to the violation of human rights of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>Steven Kwok, the A.S. director of legislative accountability, urged the senate to vote through a roll call vote “in the interest of transparency.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The public forum ended at approximately 2 a.m. and the Senate then heard statements from the resolution’s sponsors, Kaur and Tessema. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During deliberation, some senators echoed the opinions of students who spoke earlier saying the resolution was an anti-Semitic gesture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Aaron Hendizadeh said that if this resolution was solely about divestment from U.S. companies, then the drafters would not have needed to include the companies’ partnerships with Israel in the resolution text. He said he believes the resolution singles out Israel for this reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All this resolution is doing is fueling division on our campus,” he said.</span></p>\n<p>Senator Hannah Ellenhorn said the resolution ignores the cultural and religious identities of Jewish students on campus and marginalizes the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Only a minority of a community can define what hatred is against that community,” she said. “You cannot tell the Jewish community that this is not an attack on their identity.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other senators defended the resolution, insisting as students did earlier in the night that divestment from Israel is about asserting the UC’s neutrality in the Israel-Palestine conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Jonathan Lopez said the resolution does not question whether or not the state of Israel has a right to exist; rather, he said it is about withdrawing UC investments from alleged human rights violations in the Middle East.</span></p>\n<p>“We cannot be complicit in these acts anymore,” he said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, who served as a proxy for Senator Lesly Silva, said he is in solidarity with the Palestinian people as a member of Queer Commission and said he understands the feeling of being oppressed in society.</span></p>\n<div class=\"infogram-embed\" data-id=\"senator_divestment_votes\" data-type=\"interactive\" data-title=\"Senator Divestment Votes\"></div>\n<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement(\"script\");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,\"infogram-async\",\"//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");</script></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 8px 0;

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 40 people marched with signs outside of the UCSB Library and the Arbor, chanting “UC, UC, you’re no good; treat your workers like you should.” The protest was held first between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and later from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s picket line was held to show “solidarity” with the union’s bargaining team as it works toward reaching an agreement on issues like UC overstaffing and emergency layoffs, according to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Groundskeeper lead Juan Donato has worked at UCSB for seven years and joined Thursday’s protest because it is “symbolic” of the 50th anniversary of the death of two sanitation workers, who were killed on the job after their truck’s compactor malfunctioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We deserve, we matter and we deserve to be treated with respect and dignity,” he said. “[It’s] interesting for me 50 years of fighting and [we’re] still in the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident prompted a strike in Memphis, which drew approximately 1,300 workers, according to the AFSCME website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workers’ deaths “inspired Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to join in marching against poor pay and unsafe working conditions,” UCSB Student Health Medical Assistant Babe Gonzales said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzales has worked at UCSB for 28 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is about equality, security, dignity and fairness with all UC workers. What we want is protection for women, immigrants and people of color,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the workers protesting today want wages that increase with inflation, affordable health care, secure retirement and an end to the outsourcing of jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hijinio Camacho, known around UCSB and Isla Vista as “The Elotero,” also worked at the protest by serving food alongside AFSCME workers to those who were picketing.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80758\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1038365017\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80759\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80758\" data-attachment-id=\"80758\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/union-workers-march-in-remembrance-hold-picket-line-for-workers-rights/2016x1134-jpeg-804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed-large/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2016×1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80758\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hijinio Camacho served food alongside AFSCME during the picket line. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/high-insurance-costs-prevent-el-elotero-from-selling-on-campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made the decision</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not to hold fundraisers on UCSB’s campus because he cannot afford the high insurance costs required of campus vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We represent cooks, custodians, groundskeepers, so we’re right now trying to send a message to management saying that this is about equality, this is about fairness,” AFSCME organizer Mercedes Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want [the UC] to treat them right, and that’s why we have to do this,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Kile, a fifth-year chemistry major and AFSCME intern, explained that he joined the protest today because of his father, who passed away from pancreatic cancer before Kile started his senior year of high school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that his father worked two jobs, one at U.P.S. and one working full time at California Lutheran University. His mom also worked full time as a teacher while she finished attending school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was 17, he was feeling sick and he didn’t want to stop working so he kept working, kept working, and he finally went to go get checked and it turned out he had pancreatic cancer, stage four,” Kile said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He wouldn’t have had to deal with that if this country can get the concept together that a single job, 40 hours a week, should be enough to provide for you and your family. Many of our workers are working through full-time jobs. If they end up with the same thing then there’s gonna be someone else like me who loses a parent,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he has had to drop out of school and has “literally lost weight from not being able to eat.” He has also been homeless during parts of his time at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kile said that over the past 40 years, unions have been in a “sharp decline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone from Democrats to Republicans have been attacking unions for a very, very long time,” he said. “I mean, Hillary Clinton was on the board of Walmart, which was one of the biggest union busters, Elon Musk is a union buster, Jeff Bezos from Amazon hates unions and the working conditions they produce are horrific.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also referenced the wage gap between men and women, explaining that the average pay from women to men is 78 cents an hour, but for Latinx women it is approximately 55 cents an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Where do you fix that, where do you fix those inequalities across race, gender, sexuality and everything?

I would do it again if I could.”</p>\n<p>Le, who ran with Campus United during 2017 Spring Quarter elections, was elected over his Isla Vista Party opponent Nawar Nemeh and became UCSB’s first transfer student president.</p>\n<p>“I think having someone who isn’t shy to stray away from conventional norms was a very positive thing in terms of being a transfer,” Le said. “I think having a fresh, innovative perspective [is good] as someone who hasn’t been bogged down by the politics of A.S.”</p>\n<p>He ran on a platform of lowering student fees, “reclaiming” higher education by focusing on college affordability, creating student-owned businesses and “opening up” A.S. to historically marginalized communities.</p>\n<p>Throughout the one-year term of his presidency, he was effective in tackling issues involving sexual assault, addressing college affordability and opening up A.S.; however, he fell short on creating student businesses and working to lower student fees.</p>\n<p>Le addressed his first platform item, tackling college affordability, in part due to his work as a delegate within the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“Being a delegate to the California Democratic Party put me in a unique position to address [college affordability] first hand,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Le said the position allowed him and UCSB Lobby Corps to successfully address college affordability, particularly food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“We had brought forth the concept of food insecurity, which at that time was kind of a new concept, and we had told [Monique Limon] that 48 percent of UCSB students were food insecure,” he said. “Subsequently, after her term began in 2017… she introduced legislation on our behalf.”</p>\n<p>He explained the bill “ended up becoming multiple different things” but eventually <a href=\"http://ahed.assembly.ca.gov/sites/ahed.assembly.ca.gov/files/hearings/AB%20453%20analysis%202017.pdf\">Assembly Bill 453</a>, which was adopted into the state budget, resulted in $3.5 million in state funds that would be used to address food insecurity system wide.</p>\n<p>UCSB received $250,000 of that money, according to Le.</p>\n<p>He explained that the Democratic Party adopted “the most progressive party platform in the country,” which included having tuition-free colleges.</p>\n<p>“I was proud and fortunate to be a co-sponsor for that resolution,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Le said he and Lobby Corps lobbied against the proposed UC Regents tuition hikes, when the regents proposed another tuition increase.</p>\n<p>Since the year 2000, 90,000 students have been enrolled systemwide, but UC still receives the <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/support-uc/ucan/state-budget\">same level of funding</a>, according to the UC website.</p>\n<p>In mid-march, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised out-of-state tuition</a> and postponed the vote on in-state tuition following backlash.</p>\n<p>While not an item on his platform, Le said he is proud of “protecting the health and safety of students” during the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a> by asking UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang to delay Fall Quarter final exams.</p>\n<p>When the Thomas Fire first hit the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties during early December, Yang initially said the Fall Quarter would continue as scheduled.</p>\n<p>However, following several power outages and “hazardous” air quality, Le “pushed back against faculty who did not want to be inconvenienced” and met with Yang to discuss <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\">moving finals.</a></p>\n<p>Le said he sent an email to Yang, asking him to cancel finals and classes, and Yang had responded asking to meet.</p>\n<p>“[He] wanted to hear what my consultation was, in terms of what the student body needs,” Le said. “I told him, as I stated in my letter, that classes needed to be canceled, and finals need to be canceled, and that is what happened… I remained firm in my belief in protecting the health and safety of the students.”</p>\n<p>Winter Quarter began a week later than initially scheduled and Fall Quarter finals took place the week of January 8.</p>\n<p>“Having test anxiety … in addition to horrible conditions, no student should ever go to school when it was that unsafe,” Le said.</p>\n<p>On women’s issues, particularly regarding sexual assault, the A.S. President’s office was involved in the creation of a UC-wide <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">Title IX student advisory board</a>, according to Le.</p>\n<p>The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>Le said he, UC Title IX coordinator Kathleen Salvaty, UC Los Angeles student body president Arielle Mokhtarzadeh and several staff members from the UC Title IX office worked so students could have an opportunity for “real, substantial change.”</p>\n<p>“[We wanted] to be able to address many of the dangerous things that were happening federally, especially with the Title IX rollbacks from the Obama-era guidelines,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Salvaty <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/first-uc-system-wide-title-ix-coordinator-resigns/\">later resigned</a> in part due to the daily commute of the job and the board is currently working on potential amendments to the UC system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>While Le succeeded in several items on his platform, he failed to lower student fees and worked to raise them during Spring Quarter with the “NewCen” project.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\">project</a>, which involved an innovation lab, renovated food bank and a drastic remodel of the University Center, would have eventually increased student fees by close to $100 a quarter, a number that would rise due to inflation.</p>\n<p>It failed with 81.69 percent of students voting no on the A.S. Elections ballot, but not before the project became a source of controversy across campus.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say there’s anything I would have done differently with the NewCen, but I would say that I still stand by my decision to push forth that measure,” Le said.</p>\n<p>He said his decision to push for the renovation was “in line with [his] campaign values” because the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">UCen</a> is a “dying building.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very shortsighted for students to be paying into a building right now that’s dying,” Le said. “The fact that the value of those dollars that would be spent on revitalizing is worth a lot more than what is currently being paid into a building.”</p>\n<p>To the point of addressing student-owned business, Le said he was unsuccessful with his promise of student-owned businesses, because this would have been addressed in the failed UCen proposal with the innovation lab.</p>\n<p>“We formulated a very comprehensive plan… to be able to give students the opportunity to go innovate, start their own business, and take their own ideas to the marketplace,” Le said. “We attempted, and that is just the way that democracy works.”</p>\n<p>Le’s successor, Campus United candidate Brooke Kopel, won by a narrow margin of 2.04 percent over her opponent Justice Dumlao, who ran with the Isla Vista Party.</p>\n<p>Kopel, a third-year political science and history double major, is currently on the A.S. Senate as a letters and science senator and was the first senate pro-tempore.</p>\n<p>Le praised Kopel’s capabilities and encouraged her to take time to do the things she loves outside of the job.</p>\n<p>“She’s gonna do a great job,” Le said. “One piece of advice I would say is try to enjoy your senior year as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The bill is Assembly Bill 453, not Assembly Bill 451, as previously stated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
