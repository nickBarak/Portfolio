That’s not going to happen for us,” said Talia Chalhoub, a biopsychology major who will also be graduating with a certificate in technology management. “The fact that [we] can’t walk into Campbell Hall ever again … You can’t just go sit outside at Cajé anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are people that I’m never going to see again,” she added. “I’m pretending that all this has given us is an extra week at home rather than taking away any time we have remaining.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub, who also has a sister graduating from San Diego State University with the class of 2020, said she hopes to return to I.V. during spring quarter. She pays nearly $1,000 a month to live in I.V., and unlike the thousands of UCSB students who lived on-campus and were given the option to sever their dorm leases, it isn’t as easy to back out for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vistans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Chalhoub also lives in a house with 13 housemates, which she said can make it difficult to navigate the logistics of online classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know some professors might be recording [lectures] and putting them online, in which case you could just put in your headphones and you’ll be fine anywhere. But other professors are having you log on at 9 a.m. during regular class period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have a 9 a.m. and [my roommates] have 9 a.m.s and it’s a different class, are we supposed to sit in the same room? How are we supposed to participate if the sound is too loud?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub is one of thousands of UCSB students who are grappling with this unprecedented situation. The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from I.V. if they have already left for their hometowns — warning that the coronavirus can spread quickly in the packed college town — but some seniors are grappling with how to handle their last quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they stay in what has now become a “ghost town,” as put by cultural anthropology major Alex Buckley, or do they return to their hometowns and say goodbye to I.V.?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley, who is immunocompromised and works a full-time job while also taking classes, said she was initially excited when she found out that UCSB was transitioning to remote instruction for spring quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought, okay, this might be a great idea. I’m not going to have to worry about going into class. But then once it actually hit me that I wasn’t going to be able to have an actual, last quarter on campus … it made me really sad,” Buckley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t have any time to say goodbye to anybody. Or even realize that my last day of class, last quarter, was the last class I would ever take on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley said going home would be easier for her than for her peers, because her parents live in Santa Barbara. But her I.V. landlord “already told us that he’s not letting anybody out of their lease.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t have any choice but to stay [in I.V.],” she said. “I would prefer to move and get out of I.V. since there’s nothing here and nothing open anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she considered subletting but hasn’t been able to find anyone actively trying to move into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people, instead, are trying to get out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walking around, Isla Vista is such a ghost town,” she said. “It’s really weird and super quiet. There’s no cars on the street, everyone I know has left and it’s a super weird, eerie feeling.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For seniors who have already left for their hometowns, such as for English major Jasmine Garcia, their lives are up in the air — it’s unknown if they will be able to return to I.V. and carry out their senior traditions, or how they will handle remote classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garcia, who transferred to UCSB in Fall Quarter 2018, said this next quarter is going to be difficult for her to manage because she won’t have access to in-person campus resources such as Campus Learning Assistance Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I have to] become independent and find my own ways to get my essays revised,” she said. “I’m an English major, and [this] makes me feel like I don’t have any other support at the moment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that it felt like her life “completely froze for a second” when she found out that Spring Quarter 2020 would be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer, this “leaves me with one and a half years [at UCSB],” Garcia said. “I miss interacting with people and finding new connections … that was the number one thing I actually enjoyed the most [at UCSB].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Garcia, UCSB senior Sierra Hastings has also returned to her hometown. But Hastings finds herself in a unique situation for her last quarter; she’s in the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater program, along with nine other people in her senior class — a program that is “a struggle” to teach online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hastings said that her professor has been checking in with her class but noted that they’re “at the same kind of loss, like, ‘Oh my god, how are we going to teach theater and dance on a computer?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s going to be a different quality than what we would get from being in a classroom. From those physical corrections that you get at the barre or in your acting studio — creating shows together, creating when you are cast in a play — I’m not going to get any of that,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hastings said that while she is sad that there won’t be an in-person spring quarter, she knows these measures are meant for the better of UCSB students and the greater community — but she’ll miss the day-to-day activities that being on campus brings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of this is a lot to take in, but at the end of the day, this is the best decision for the community and the world at large,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been really fortunate to have so many wonderful memories … [I’ll miss] the rehearsal rooms that we have on campus. I feel like those were the rooms that I’ve really grown in as a person, I’ve just learned so much about myself, about the community … I feel like I’ve really spent 3.7 years in those rehearsal rooms at theater dance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that her nine-person senior class in the training program has been discussing possibly holding a smaller graduation just for her program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been training together for three years,” Hastings said. “Finding out we wouldn’t be together for our last quarter was heartbreaking.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

In Santa Barbara County, there are </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-27/coronavirus-in-santa-barbara-county-case-counts-and-locations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, 38 UCSB students have been tested for the coronavirus, with no positive results as of yet, Javanbakht said. As of March 25, 18 tests have come back negative and 20 tests are pending results, which can take up to a week to get back. All 38 tests were conducted through </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-labcorp-quest-diagnostics-are-growing-testing-capacity.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quest Diagnostics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a private testing laboratory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-08/ucsb-student-health-executive-director-explains-coronavirus-protocol-and-ongoing-measures/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">months</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Student Health has adhered to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the coronavirus and worked with numerous campus entities to devise transmission prevention measures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But recently, Javanbakht said Student Health has also begun designating a prescription pickup area, conducting virtual appointments and cordoning off a section of Student Health so “students who have any kind of respiratory symptom are in a separate part of the building” and to minimize contact between students and workers at Student Health, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any student who visits Student Health during this time will have their temperature taken and will be asked if they are experiencing any symptoms associated with the coronavirus, such as fever, shortness of breath or cough, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our main goal is to do what we can to help our students so that if they end up needing to go to an outside urgent care or emergency room — if COVID spreads as we expect it to — urgent cares and emergency rooms can be really overrun and their demands can be really high,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said that although the off-campus area is out of Student Health’s purview, the university “acknowledges that they are closely tied” with Isla Vista, where thousands of UCSB students packed their bags to ride out the pandemic at home. As a result, the university is closely monitoring how safe it is for students to not only return to campus, but also to Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from Isla Vista if they can; in an email sent out to the student body on March 23, the university urged students to stay at home if they traveled for spring break, noting that Isla Vista has a population of more than 20,000 in less than two square miles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said it is “highly unlikely” that things will return to normal by the end of spring quarter, but “depending on how well we implement our interventions now, as far as social distancing, that could put us in a good position [to return in the] summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the situation doesn’t improve by summer, he said, “we could be looking at fall” for in-person classes to resume.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amidst cancellations and closures, from UCSB’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-26/breaking-ucsb-postpones-commencement-will-host-virtual-ceremony-in-june/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postponed commencement ceremony</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announced Thursday to the order for all </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-25/as-santa-barbara-county-tightens-grip-on-coronavirus-prevention-i-v-businesses-hollow-out/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-essential businesses to close</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many young adults </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/deniers-and-disbelievers-if-i-get-corona-i-get-corona.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have ignored calls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for social distancing in favor of going out and spending time with friends. But students can risk infecting themselves and others when they do so, Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the virus transmits through “secretions” that come from coughing, talking or exhaling, the closer people are to one another, the higher the risk their interactions carry, he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re talking about interacting in a way that would be less risky, interacting outside is always better than any kind of indoor space,” he said. “And keeping six feet regardless of where you are, even outdoors, is much better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In transmitting the virus, Javanbakht said each person acts like an “ember.” People who have the virus can spread it to those who do not — by seeing friends, going out and entering other people’s personal spaces — and create a wildfire of contagion, but by staying at home, “the fire’s not going to spread anywhere because it’s contained within [a] house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication among housemates also matters, Javanbahkt said. For people who plan to stay in I.V. and are living with multiple housemates, he stressed the importance of keeping outside interactions to a minimum — all it takes is one housemate to spread the virus to everyone in the house.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody has three roommates and they’ve lived together all year and they plan to stay together for the rest of spring quarter, that’s great,” he said. “As long as they keep it to those three people and they don’t have people coming over or going over to someone else’s house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all in-person classes have been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">canceled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Javanbakht said campus entities from all corners of the university frequently meet to discuss protocols, contingency plans and emergency operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entities include the UCSB COVID-19 Task Force, made up of the chancellor, vice chancellor, faculty and financial department members, as well as the COVID-19 operations team, which includes the vice chancellor and representatives from Student Health and Housing and Dining Services, he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was during these twice-a-day meetings, which he said have been taking place for several weeks, that campus entities such as the University Library and Recreation Center made the decision to close indefinitely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said the university plans to update the student body about which services they can access during a digital spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the updates will detail “what’s going to be done remotely, what kinds of services are available in person, what’s operating and what’s not operating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are plenty of [messages] that will be coming out as the situation evolves,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-93746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">VSS invites spokespeople from companies such as Invoca’s Director of Sales Development Anders Vazquez. <em>Courtesy of Trent Waltz</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History of public policy and law major Trent Waltz said he came up with the idea for such a program while he was interning at the Vendition Sales Society (VSS), a nonprofit national collegiate club for students interested in a sales career. Waltz, who is the co-creator and head of the organization’s UCSB chapter, said that the club’s main focus is to run sales events that include guest speakers and panels. VSS also hosts instructional workshops and invites spokespeople from companies like Procore and Tesla, who speak to students about what it’s like to work in sales after college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the club offers a number of resources, Waltz explained that the program’s singular goal is to help “fellow Gauchos get a foot in the door in an increasingly competitive job market.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While interning for VSS this past summer, Waltz met the people who would soon work with him to bring his idea for the Collegiate Sales Certification (CSC) program to life. These other interns went on to set up CSC programs at their own schools too: UC Berkeley student Michael Williams became head of the UC Berkeley chapter, Shannon Chau, head of the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo chapter and JennaRae DeMaio, head of the San Diego State chapter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waltz said that he is adamant about making sure that all of the program’s events hold a purpose and provide helpful tools and information to students. But in terms of obstacles, exposure and consistency are big ones, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being that [this] is a new campus org … having that momentum is so key to really keeping a club going,” Waltz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coronavirus pandemic, however, has put a hold on the club’s meetings and workshops. To accommodate this change, Waltz said that he and his team are working to adapt the in-person workshops that were scheduled for spring into an online format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Waltz, the program functions on three main pillars: structuring an opportunity, salesforce certification and cold-calling tactics. The first focuses on creating sales opportunities, invoking responses and cadence structure — using language to convince customers to open up, creating an opportunity to make a sale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second pillar entails creating a new contact and taking them all the way from new lead to opportunity and close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third pillar is the cold-calling skill, where students practice nearly 200 cold calls to familiarize themselves with the process.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the program is designed for students to pick and choose what modules and workshops they want to complete, they “don’t have to do the entire thing,” Waltz said, adding that modular learning eliminates the hassle of having to sit through workshops that aren’t of interest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want this club to be something that can benefit the entirety of the UCSB student body. My vision [is to make] sure that us Gauchos are that much better prepared to go out into the real world and have that competitive edge,” Waltz said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/ucsb-fourth-year-launches-collegiate-sales-certification-program/","id":1815,"author":{"id":256,"name":"KJ Clay"},"related":[1814,1813,1812],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
