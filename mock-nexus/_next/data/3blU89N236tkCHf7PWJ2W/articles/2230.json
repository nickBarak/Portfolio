renewable energy sources. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>On Sept. 4, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) announced in a press release that this “expansion of its system-wide sustainability goals” was a part of the UC’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>The Carbon Neutrality Initiative began in 2013, when UC President Janet Napolitano proposed the goal of making the UCs a zero net energy consumer by 2025.</p>\n<p>Along with the 2013 commitment to become carbon neutral, UC now also aims for “100 percent reliance on clean electricity suppliers across its campuses and medical centers by 2025,” according to the press release.</p>\n<p>UC has already saved $220 million by utilizing its energy efficiency programs.</p>\n<p>At UC Santa Barbara, students have been working on the 100 Percent Campaign for the past two years, according to Adriana Munoz, the vice chair of UCSB’s California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) branch.</p>\n<p>“CALPIRG Students have been working very hard to create buzz about renewable energy by talking to thousands of students about this issue and signing them up as members to our organization,” Munoz said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also worked with other student organizations as well as with faculty to show overall campus support for this issue.”</p>\n<p>She added that the campaign has been a priority due to the effects of climate change on California, which include fires that have occurred close to UCSB’s campus, such as the Thomas Fire, the second largest fire in the state’s history.</p>\n<p>“We are so proud that our UC system is working with students in order to take more steps towards a clean energy future and CALPIRG Students looks forward to working with them on this issue further,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>UC is also committed to not using on-site fossil fuel combustion for new buildings and renovations after June 2019, as well as reducing its overall energy-use intensity, the press release said.</p>\n<p>The UC commitment precedes Governor Jerry Brown’s signing of Senate Bill 100 on Sept. 10.</p>\n<p>SB 100, authored by State Senator Kevin de León, requires the state of California to use 100-percent renewable and zero-carbon electricity sources by 2045.</p>\n<p>“With Governor Brown’s order, California establishes the most ambitious carbon neutrality commitment of any major economic jurisdiction in the world,” a press release from Gov. Brown said.</p>\n<p>“It will not be easy. It will not be immediate. But it must be done.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Sept. 20 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

The first of the Asks would expand this amount to three.</p>\n<p>“We do think that there’s a disconnect between students and the people who are in the power to make decisions about students,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The second of the Asks requests that UCSB must provide SASA with “the funds to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>The reach of the campaign depends on the amount of funding the university provides, Montalvo-Telford added.</p>\n<p>The third Ask says that the UCSB Title IX office “must provide an annual Public Accountability Report as modeled by the UCLA Title IX office.”</p>\n<p>UC Los Angeles’s (UCLA) <a href=\"https://equity.ucla.edu/public_accountability/public_accountability_reports/\">Public Accountability Report</a> provides “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>“I think that there’s mystery surrounding the Title IX office; we don’t really know what’s going on in there … I think that being at least transparent about the stats of what’s going on in there is comforting, as a student,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final of the Asks says UCSB “must create a paid position for a SASA member to organize an hour long conversation about consent and sexual violence.”</p>\n<p>This position would replace the current Gaucho FYI content on consent and sexual violence, and it would “act as its own subsection of Gaucho FYI.”</p>\n<p>“The way that consent is being taught at Gaucho FYI … limits the way that consent is able to be talked about,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think that consent really stops at ‘yes means yes.’ It’s more than that,” Montolvo-Telford added. “It’s talking about, ‘What does consent actually looks like inside of the bedroom? How do we use it in practice and not just in definition?’”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford believes that the benefit of having a SASA member give the presentation is that a SASA member would have more freedom than a Gaucho FYI presenter.</p>\n<p>“We are able to include things that were necessarily restricted before,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>In theory, a member of SASA would not have these restrictions, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>SASA does not have a set number in mind for the wage of the position.</p>\n<p>The list of Asks has been endorsed by A.S. President Brooke Kopel, External Vice President of Local Affairs Jeike Meijer, Lobby Corps, I Am That Girl, Hermanos, the Armenian Student Association, Making Adventures Possible for All Students (M.A.P.A.S) and Stop the Traffik L.A.</p>\n<p>“As the first woman president that UCSB has had in the past four years, sexual assault issues are at the top of my priorities,” Kopel said in an email. “I unequivocally agreed that each and every one of those asks should and must be implemented by our university administration.”</p>\n<p>SASA is currently working on a resolution with on-campus senator Zion Solomon and off-campus senator Christian Ornelas that endorses the list of Asks, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to have it in front of Senate by next week,” Montalvo-Telford said. “We are prepared to make our argument in support.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the Asks, SASA released the <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/projects/#survey\">results of a survey</a> that was conducted during Spring Quarter 2018. The responses were collected anonymously during a two-week time frame and all participants were associated with UCSB.</p>\n<p>The survey results included data regarding sexual assault, survivors’ reasoning for not reporting, respondents’ knowledge of resources and policies and attitudes toward the university.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to see that the reason why folks chose not to report was because that they felt that the offense was not serious enough,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The data from the survey helped SASA determine how the Asks should be structured, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We definitely believe that all of these Asks are necessary to our campus. What they look like requires a conversation between us and the administration. All of them, in their thesis, are necessary for this campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

analyst for the current EVPSA office. Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The special election comes following the disqualification of Mayela Morales, a fifth-year global studies and Chicanx studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the position of External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) in April. However, she was later found to not be enrolled in any classes at UCSB during the Spring Quarter, according to Gaucho On-Line Database (G.O.L.D.) public records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Legal Code mandates that executive candidates be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Because Morales was disqualified approximately three weeks after the elections were held, UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. Elections Board mandated a special election to be held for the EVPSA position during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Although Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, is the only officially declared candidate, potential write-in candidates may join the race.</p>\n<p>Write-in candidates must declare candidacy by emailing the A.S. Elections Board by Oct. 7, John Paul Renteria, the chair of A.S. Elections Board, said at a Senate meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>For the special election, there is still a minimum voting threshold of 16 percent, meaning 16 percent of UC Santa Barbara students need to vote in order for the results to be valid, according to Renteria.</p>\n<p>If this voter threshold is not met, the A.S. Elections Board will extend one week to the voting period.</p>\n<p>If the threshold still is not met after the week extension, the EVPSA office will be vacant until the A.S. Spring 2019 elections.</p>\n<p>A.S Senate passed a resolution in July which split the position’s funds and duties among several individuals.</p>\n<p>Temporary access to EVPSA funds were granted to the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S. President, the A.S. President Proxy, and the Lobby Corps Co-Chairs.</p>\n<p>Their duties will be dissolved “the date that the new EVPSA is sworn-in,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the co-chair of Lobby Corps and served as a policy analyst for the current EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>During the EVPSA candidate forum in April, Loudon detailed her plans if elected into the position, which included securing “state investment” which does not just apply to fighting tuition hikes, but also to getting the State of California to invest in all issues affecting students.</p>\n<p>Loudon added that voter registration would also be a priority of hers. Loudon also said she wanted to increase education surrounding how students can utilize existing mental health resources.</p>\n<p>The candidate forums for the Special Election will take place on Oct. 5, and active campaigning will take place on Oct. 7.</p>\n<p>The voting period will begin on Oct. 15 and will end on Oct. 18, when the results will be released.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
