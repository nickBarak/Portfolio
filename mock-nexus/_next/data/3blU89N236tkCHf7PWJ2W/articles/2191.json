Brown Act of 1953 “guarantees the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies,” according to a pamphlet published by the California Attorney General’s Office in 2003.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The act requires that all boards, commissions and councils publicly detail the items they plan to discuss in closed session before closing the meeting to the public. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closed meetings are those in which the public and executives are excluded,  Safadi said.</span></p>\n<p>Safadi explained the Brown Act applies to the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate because of academic senate clause.</p>\n<p>“In 66 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 252 (1983), it is concluded that the meetings of an academic senate of [colleges] are subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act,” Safadi said to the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“[Academic senate is] a blanket statement that covers all forms of legislation in universities… that is what I understood it to say,” she added. “Furthermore, the Brown Act is directly referred to in the [A.S.] legal code and thus associated students has subjected itself to its bylaws.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week’s closed session was unusual in that Senate asked A.S. Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho and A.S. Executive Director </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela Márquez </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to leave as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As an individual who was explicitly stated to not be a part of the closed session, I also cannot comment on what was discussed since I was not permitted to be present,” Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Rafael Cornejo first motioned to go into a closed meeting to </span>“to discuss internals,” according to meeting minutes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cornejo rescinded his initial motion but made a second motion around 7:30 p.m., this time specifying that the meeting would discuss “internals of A.S. and increasing accountability with senators and proxies only.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi sent out an email to all A.S. executives, senators and advisors on Nov. 2, warning senators that they “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must adhere to the Brown Act in its fullest capacity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Violations [of the Brown Act] may result in external litigation and repercussions,” Safadi said in the email obtained by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The attorney general simply informed senators on how to go about closed sessions,” Ho said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate must include both intent to have a closed meeting and a description of the content of the closed meeting that is descriptive enough to provide the public with a semblance of the topic, according to Safadi’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they take any action during the meeting, the Senate would be required to disclose those votes or actions to the public within 24 hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate is only allowed to go into closed session to discuss personnel, public security, pending litigation, labor negotiations and real property negotiations, according to the Brown Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safadi highlighted personnel and pending litigation in her email as the two reasons more relevant as to why Senate would hold a closed session.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Nov. 8]: This article’s title was updated to “A.S.

The UCen Governance Board will hear presentations from various businesses and ultimately vote on which one to rent to.</p>\n<p>The board will put together a Request for Proposal (RFP), in which they will “choose a specific type of business that [they] want to go after” or leave options more open-ended, Lawrence said.</p>\n<p>The space is unusual in that it does not have a kitchen and instead has a classroom. Before Kaplan occupied it, the space was filled by various travel agencies.</p>\n<p>“It’s a very weird space,” Rose Ettleson, undergraduate representative on the board, said. “I can’t even think off the top of my head who to occupy that space.”</p>\n<p>Ettleson, a fourth-year environmental studies and film and media studies double major, expressed concerns about the possibility of UCPD filling the space.</p>\n<p>“As undergraduate students on this campus, police presence is something that is not always welcomed,” she said, noting that the UCPD inquiry was still in the “very beginning stages.”</p>\n<p>“Obviously I don’t want there to be just one option unless it really seems like a good option.”</p>\n<p>UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson said in an email that if they were to secure the space, it would primarily be used for “community policing and [a] Community Service Officer (CSO) station.”</p>\n<p>Currently, UCPD’s station is a 20-minute walk from the center of campus.</p>\n<p>“This space could enable the UC Police Department and its members to more effectively and routinely interact with the campus community in non-enforcement contacts.”</p>\n<p>Olson said the appeal of the space is its central location on campus and its proximity to other campus organizations and entities.</p>\n<p>While UCPD has not submitted a formal proposal, Olson listed the task as a priority for 2019, along with identifying a source of funding if UCPD is chosen.</p>\n<p>The space does not have a fixed rent, Lawrence said, although Kaplan paid approximately $8.50 per square foot.</p>\n<p>For now, the campus bookstore will use the space at the beginning of Winter Quarter for the book reservation program that they typically hold in the lobby.</p>\n<p>Lawrence hopes the board can find an entity to fill the space as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“We just would like to find somebody who’s willing to pay the most rent possible,” he joked.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The event was organized by Senator Solomon (left). <em>Courtesy of Zion Solomon</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB students, led by UCSB Associated Students Senator Zion Solomon, organized the “Trans Joy Take Over” to increase visibility within the trans community.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to bring a positive movement and show trans people that they are seen and visible and show people why it’s important to show solidarity with trans folks even if they aren’t trans themselves,” said Solomon, a second-year history of public policy major.</p>\n<p>The effort consisted of card- and poster-making activities on Monday and Tuesday in the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) room, located within the Student Resource Building (SRB).</p>\n<p>Students also tabled in the Arbor on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>\n<p>These events were supported with funds from the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) and RCSGD, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>“I know that suicide rates for trans people are rising and it’s not good for the mental health of trans people to be seeing this in the media, so regardless of whether they’re home or here, people are affected by it,” they said.</p>\n<p>Several other volunteers joined Solomon in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Andres, a second-year sociology major, expressed that this event could be very informative and valuable to people without much knowledge of the transgender community.</p>\n<p>“I think having visibility, having trans flags and rainbow flags out here and all of our signs really can leave an impact on someone who might not know a lot about the trans or LGBTQ+ community,” Andres said.</p>\n<p>Diego Reyes, a second-year biology major who tabled on Thursday, is adamant about the drastic implications the Trump Administration’s policy might have.</p>\n<p>“I know there are a lot of people who have their own opinions on what being transgender means and about what being non-binary means,” Reyes said. “I feel like that passing gives them a pass to spread trans antagonism and trans hatred… And I think if that passes then it’s gonna come back probably a hundred times worse [than it already is].”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“It’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UCSB’s administration has “been pretty responsive to trans needs” but always has room to improve, Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Their primary concern is how the environment created by students on campus for transgender people could potentially see a big change following the gender redefinition policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that this will affect this university’s response. Maybe the students’ response and maybe transphobic people at this university, but I think we should still be pushing the university to support trans students regardless of whatever the administration says,” Solomon said.</p>\n<p>Riley Hsieh, a second-year political science major, talked about the importance of support from allies who extend beyond just the queer and trans community.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important that we have allies in the community… because it’s a very difficult existence when your whole identity is being questioned… scrutinized repeatedly throughout the course of your day, throughout the course of your life.”</p>\n<p>Ivana Cruz spoke about how mistakes in pronoun use, whether deliberate or not, can feel invalidating and isolating, “especially in academic circles.”</p>\n<p>“Even if there’s a slip with a pronoun and they don’t take time to acknowledge that, it can really intimidate you from an already-intimidating process of reaching out to your professors.”</p>\n<p>However, Cruz stressed that solidarity can lead to progress and inclusivity and positive change.</p>\n<p>“I try to look at what’s possible. I look at the fact that 20 years ago we wouldn’t be having an event like this. We wouldn’t be having open conversations about pronouns without being laughed at. They, them would still be grammatically incorrect,” Cruz said.</p>\n<p>“I just think that we as a community have a responsibility to grow more and that’s essentially what’s going to lead to a very progressing change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/80db14dfe2699b2458e37eea83e96a1f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/ashley-rusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Ashley Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Ashley Rusch is a staff writer for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

She also spoke of where the movement stands now, a year after #MeToo gained viral attention.</p>\n<p>In the larger political sphere, Burke’s presence on campus was timely; introduction speaker Celesta Billeci, Arts &amp; Lectures Executive Director, noted Burke’s appearance was just one day before the midterm elections where more women ran for office at record numbers.</p>\n<p>Burke weaved together anecdotes of her activism in a lecture that was surprisingly humorous, given the heavy nature of the topic of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>What was unsurprising was the humanity and personal touch, as seen in both her lecture and at a reception held immediately before. The reception, held in the Mosher Alumni House, welcomed a group of 40 to speak to Burke before her Campbell Hall Lecture.</p>\n<p>Students were selected to attend the reception through the Black Studies and Feminist Studies Departments, which co-hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Burke went from table to table during the Mosher House reception, asking about students’ majors.</p>\n<p>She also reflected to the group on what the #MeToo movement still has to accomplish.</p>\n<p>“It just pains me that survivors have been forgotten. We have built this movement on the stories of survivors…for what?”</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. peer educator Jasmine Wahab described speaking with Burke as shocking.</p>\n<p>“She’s just so influential, so incredible,” Wahab said.</p>\n<p>Burke’s lecture focused not only on her own work in activism, but how the #MeToo movement has changed since its viral re-emergence in 2016. The Kavanaugh hearings in September were a reminder to Burke of how much work remains in the national conversation around sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I thought that we were further along than we were… [the Kavanaugh hearings were] a missed opportunity to examine what accountability looks like,” Burke said.</p>\n<p>Burke said the hearings became too partisan, and that led to people forgetting the greater message regarding Kavanaugh’s behavior.</p>\n<p>“There’s a straight line in my mind between a 17-year-old Kavanaugh… who was not told ‘no’ very often, and the 57-year-old man who has an unchecked amount of power and can make choices about my body,” she said.</p>\n<p>In her lecture, Burke spoke candidly about the difference between the media’s perceptions of the #MeToo movement and the work which the organization is accomplishing, which she described as #MeToo “writ large and writ little.”</p>\n<p>Those who see the #MeToo movement as just a hashtag are only seeing the “writ large,” according to Burke.</p>\n<p>Over 12 million people posted #MeToo on Facebook just 24 hours after its use by actress Alyssa Milano on Oct.15, 2017, but Burke reminded the audience that “every single hashtag is a human being.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84863\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84863\" data-attachment-id=\"84863\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-11/metoo-founder-tarana-burke-speaks-at-ucsb/jenny-luo_tarana-burke_online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jenny Luo_Tarana Burke_ONLINE-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84863 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jenny-Luo_Tarana-Burke_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84863\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Burke spoke to a full crowd Tuesday night.<em> Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Burke does not view the #MeToo movement as sustainable if it remains tied only to social media.</p>\n<p>“What they have done is not sustainable, not a movement, but a reaction to a moment. […] it’s a distraction from our real work,” she said.</p>\n<p>Sustainability comes from #MeToo “writ little,” which includes everything behind the hashtag.</p>\n<p>“Me Too is a global community of survivors committed to healing and action, including marginalized survivors of all identities, including queer and trans. The rest is a distraction from that,” Burke said.</p>\n<p>“Do recognize the urgency of this movement. Think of those waiting to be seen, to be heard, to be believed.”</p>\n<p>Burke plans soon to expand #MeToo mission beyond the hashtag. New work including survivor leadership training will be unveiled in January 2019, while a new website will be completed in April.</p>\n<p>“[The website will be] the most comprehensive website for survivors of sexual violence,” Burke said, to the eruption of applause from the audience.</p>\n<p>While #MeToo is about the stories of individuals, Burke emphasized in her lecture that the movement emphasizes community healing, changing the culture of sexual violence through law and policy changes.</p>\n<p>This change in culture can happen at the college level, Burke said.</p>\n<p>She personalized her message on Monday to UCSB in particular by reading UCSB’s mission statement aloud, describing the commitment to sustainability as brilliant.</p>\n<p>Burke also challenged the administration to examine how UCSB’s policies regarding sexual assault can fit this mission. The power in the mission statement, according to Burke, is having a “clear guide to create policies and shift culture.”</p>\n<p>“Students, this is built around you. Not the founders, not the board of trustees. You have the power now.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
