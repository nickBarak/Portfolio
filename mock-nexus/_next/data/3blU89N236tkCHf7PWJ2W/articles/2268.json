Yang, A.S. President Hieu Le and other university members went to Sacramento to meet with legislators and lobby for “budget asks and what [A.S.] determines to be priorities.”</p>\n<p>The group asked legislators for $140 million to address “deferred maintenance, over enrollment [for the 2017-18 school year] and buying out the tuition increase.”</p>\n<p>The latter was in response to Governor Brown’s proposed budget for the UC, which was significantly less than the Regents expected.</p>\n<p>The results of their efforts will be seen in June when the legislators create a budget for the UC and submit it to the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>In addition to lobbying for students, Hsu promised to “advocate for the establishment of a campus-based Middle Class Scholarship for UCSB students as a response to the elimination of the CA Middle Class Scholarship.”</p>\n<p>Initially, Brown planned to eliminate it, but later decided not to following public and legislative backlash.</p>\n<p>Since the scholarship was never eliminated a replacement was not necessary to implement, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also fulfilled her goal of bringing all candidates running for California Governor to UCSB to speak with students.</p>\n<p>Governor Candidate Delaine Eastin visited UCSB on Earth Day, Antonio Villaraigosa will be visiting in a few weeks, and both John Chiang and Gavin Newsom are planning to visit before the June 5 primaries, according to Hsu.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s final platform item stated she would “collaborate with key state and student organizers to work on a system-wide campaign to reclaim the cost of higher education during the 2018 election.” Hsu said she has worked with Reclaim California’s Higher Education Coalition throughout the school year to create an informational video, released in October, that explains how people of all backgrounds can achieve higher education.</p>\n<p>“In some shape or form I have responded to all my platorm points,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said she is most proud of helping unite students voices at UCSB with state legislators who can make changes to the higher education system, specifically in regards to their fight for increased budgets.</p>\n<p>“It’s always been a struggle of whether these powers or institutions or higher authorities will take students seriously,” she said. “I think this year the work that UCSB students have done really shows that we are a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Hsu said the money the EVPSA’s office received for the 2017-2018 school year went to funding their advocacy trips and events the office hosted throughout the year, including the GOP tax panel last fall, which featured Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“This panel was set to inform people about how [the GOP tax] would affect both undergraduate and graduate students alike,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also partnered with Rose Le, the EVPSA office’s mental health coordinator, to organize a panel for the science, technology, engineering and mathematics students on campus to aid them in maintaining their mental health amidst the stresses of their heavy class load.</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, the Re-Ignite coordinator for EVPSA, praised Hsu and the rest of the team for the work they were able to accomplish this year.</p>\n<p>“[The EVPSA is] one of the most productive A.S. exec offices and I am going to miss being able to work with such down-to-earth people in the ‘real world,’” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara and Hsu partnered together to work on projects including the establishment of permIGNITE, an organization on campus that works to “empower the marginalized voices that proudly exist within the UC campuses and beyond,” according to the EVPSA’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the biggest challenge that both she and her team faced over the year was time.</p>\n<p>“Everyone else works on this regular calendar year January through December, but student leaders work May to May which is odd,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the unusual time differences were difficult because students live such different lives than regular government officials.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s elected successor was fourth-year global and Chicanx studies double major Mayela Morales, who was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified from her position</a> by A.S. Elections Board on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>As she transitions out of her position, Hsu wants the student body to know about all the hard work that both she and the rest of A.S. do throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is really a space for students to be their own advocates and … to feel empowered on the issues that they care about,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/","id":2268,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2267,2266,2265],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf","biography":"Not available","articles":[2222,2239,2249,2266,2268,2308,2311,2769,3653,3769,3948,4329,4331],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Term in Review: S.A.G.

After a year in office, he looks back on his term as filled with challenges,  accomplishments and advocacy.</p>\n<p>“I think that to be S.A.G., you have to have a very present voice. You have to be willing to be vocal and be present,” Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>The responsibilities of the student advocate general (S.A.G.) include overseeing the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) and its staff, educating the student body on students’ rights and promoting awareness of services offered by the office.</p>\n<p>OSA’s role on campus is to inform and assist students facing charges from UC Santa Barbara in issues relating to housing, academics, public interest and social conduct, essentially “serving as the campus public defender,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>S.A.G. is also required to act as a nonpartisan representative for all undergraduates on campus, according to the A.S. Elections Code.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum, a fourth-year economics major, said his term was filled with both growth and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>In leading new projects expanding the purview of the OSA as well as maintaining efficiency of the caseworkers, Tannenbaum said he had to balance the needs of individual students as well as those of the student body as a whole.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum led projects including the polling analyst project, rewriting the legal code for positions in OSA and renovating the OSA website.</p>\n<p>OSA case workers work with students individually, guiding them through the university’s judicial process. This can include helping students organize their case documents, providing mediation and accompanying hearings, according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>He said one of the biggest projects during his term was the polling analyst project, which he claims stemmed from his commitment to nonpartisanship as well as his determination to innovate strategies for representing UCSB’s student body, he said.</p>\n<p>The project was initiated in Fall Quarter of 2017 and aims to shed light on marginalized or underrepresented voices at UCSB by polling the student body on their opinions and needs, according to Tannenbaum.</p>\n<p>The poll was intended to be included at the end of the ballet form for A.S. elections, but due to setbacks had to be postponed until a later time. The poll will be implemented before the end of the year, Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>“Starting a project from scratch is tough and I would say we were in new territory in how we wanted to implement this,” he said.</p>\n<p>He said it was important to collect substantive information about the priorities of students so he could bring it to the attention of the A.S. and continued to pursue this project despite obstacles that arose.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson, OSA chief of staff, worked closely with Tannenbaum during his term and attributed his successes in outreach as S.A.G. in part to his charismatic personality.</p>\n<p>Alex Funk, OSA external deputy chief, said Tannenbaum’s character played a role in the hiring process for OSA case workers.</p>\n<p>“He wasn’t necessarily so focused on purely technically minded or technically sound people, what he was focused on was people that he could work with,” Funk said. “You’re not looking just at merit, you’re looking at like the more holistic view of a person and I thought that was really admirable.”</p>\n<p>During his term, Tannenbaum revamped the OSA website, which when he entered the position, had errors throughout its pages including incorrectly listing past a S.A.G. as current a current caseworker.</p>\n<p>Tannenbaum also spoke to transfer students in lectures about the role of the OSA in assisting students with issues like plagiarism.</p>\n<p>Instead of speaking about a focus point of judicial consequences, Tannenbaum instead spoke to students about the advocacy that OSA can provide when students have issues that bring them to the OSA office.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made some inroads in kind of strengthening relationships between our office and administration which is really vital to making sure we can best advocate for students,” Tannenbaum said.</p>\n<p>In Tannenbaum’s campaign platform, he estimated that the OSA office served approximately 20 cases per quarter. This year, Tannenbaum estimated that OSA served as many students this year as last year, and possibly more.</p>\n<p>Before coming into office Tannenbaum did not have previous experience in the OSA, but he said his time serving as a proxy during Senate meetings cultivated an appreciation he now holds for nonpartisan work and led him to the position in his final year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He also said he has found fulfillment in helping students find resolutions to the issues that bring them to OSA.</p>\n<p>“Our office provides a space and people who are there to say ‘you’re not alone.

This allows for flexibility among both students and staff schedules, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain free counseling for students, long-term counseling is not offered at UCSB, according to Honegger. Students who desire long-term counseling are typically referred to clinicians within the community that can provide more in-depth support.</p>\n<p>“Some students who have a greater need [for more frequent counseling] are seen for longer; it depends on their financial resources and their level of need and what other alternative services are available out there,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>“Some universities like Stanford … offer long term therapy. [However] the moment you want longer term services, you [are] converted to utilizing your insurance,” he added.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. currently has one psychologist for every 967 students and is aiming to expand to have one psychologist for every 750 students, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.’ desire] is to hire more clinicians and hopefully with that we’ll be able to serve more people and more efficiently serve them,” he said.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] believes very strongly that mental health resources should be available to all students … [because of this] it’s hard to have long term therapy options,” he said.</p>\n<p>A future in which long-term counseling is offered at UCSB is a possibility, Honegger said. However, that would require C.A.P.S. to have a “bigger budget, a bigger building, and … more clinicians.”</p>\n<p>Honneger said he believes most students are satisfied with the current short-term model C.A.P.S. follows.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, students just want help getting through a rough time and don’t necessarily want the norm to be long term, extensive, and in-depth therapy,” he said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. concentrates on assisting students seeking help from professionals in building self-confidence, reducing stress and solving problems among other things, according to <a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu\">C.A.P.S.’ website</a>.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] serves a pretty large percent of the student body,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>In the future, C.A.P.S. hopes to hire a social worker or a family therapist to do initial assessments of the students prior to providing counseling or psychological services.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. is open Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Students can also contact the office directly at (805) 893-4411.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared

electrical equipment was associated with an ignition near Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula — one of at least two origin points for the Thomas Fire,” Southern California Edison (SCE) said in press release sent out on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>However, the statement noted that there were other factors that contributed to the Thomas Fire, including dry vegetation, high temperatures and strong winds.</p>\n<p>“Wildfire risk is increasing at the same time as more and more residential and commercial development is occurring in some of the highest-risk areas — with over a quarter of SCE’s service territory in high fire risk areas identified on the CPUC’s (California Public Utilities Commision) fire risk maps,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>SCE is now awaiting permission from the California Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to further their investigation into the causes of the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p>According to the press release, CAL FIRE has removed equipment located near Koenigstein Road, so SCE has not yet been able to inspect it. “SCE will not be able to determine the specific cause of the Koenigstein Road ignition until it can analyze the equipment currently in CAL FIRE’s possession.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, SCE is conducting an ongoing study regarding the causes of the Thomas Fire. This study takes an in-depth look into possible ignition points and fire progression from each point, among other factors.</p>\n<p>SCE is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S., serving about 15 million customers in Southern California, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire devastated the Santa Barbara area last December, burning over 281,893 acres of land. It was the largest fire in California history at the time, until it was surpassed by the Mendocino Complex Fire in July 2018.</p>\n<p>During the fire, UC Santa Barbara <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\">opened</a> its recreation center to evacuees from the Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Associated Students Senate also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/a-s-senate-allocates-5000-to-help-students-head-home-during-thomas-fire/\">allocated</a> over $2,000 to students who needed to return home because of the fire.
