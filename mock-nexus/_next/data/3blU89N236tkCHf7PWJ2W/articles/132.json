Trailing 7-2, junior Andrew Riminton and red shirt sophomore Morgan Mays battled back to 7-6 before falling in the next set on court three. As court one stood at a stalemate 6-6, the Red Raiders took a second victory on court two over Galskov and sophomore Teague Hamilton 8-4. Texas Tech headed into singles play leading 1-0.</p>\n<p>The Red Raiders took another big jump on the Gauchos taking the first two singles matches of the day. No. 123 sophomore Jolan Cailleau defeated freshman Cody Rakela in straight sets of 6-2. Mays nearly forced a third set against No. 117 freshman Alex Sendegeya, but was defeated 6-3, 7-5. Texas Tech went up 3-0, in need of just one more win, and play was suspended due to rainfall.</p>\n<p>Just under an hour later, play resumed and the Gauchos began to make a stand. Sophomore Erik Johnsson put UCSB on the board taking a victory on court five in straight sets. Johnsson defeated his opponent, senior Francisco Zambon, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Junior Nathan Eshmade was the next to keep the Gauchos alive on court two. He took down junior Hugo Dojas after forcing a third set 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.</p>\n<p>Down just 3-2, UCSB needed victories from both Galskov and Hamilton. Hamilton fought hard on court six losing the first set 6-7(4-7) to freshman Connor Curry. He found himself trailing just 4-5 in the second, looking to force a third set, but his match was called off due to the finish on court one.</p>\n<p>Galskov took on No. 37 junior Felipe Soares and forced him to a third set as they split the first two 4-6, 6-3. The junior Red Raider solidified his team’s spot in the next round taking the third set 6-1 over Galskov.</p>\n<p>“I know the team is very good right now and we’ve progressed so much this year,” Galskov said. “I think they can do a lot of great things next year.”</p>\n<p>This match concludes UCSB’s season. The team’s recruiting report is soon to come<strong>. </strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/mens-tennis-knocked-out-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/mens-tennis-knocked-out-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/mens-tennis-knocked-out-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/mens-tennis-knocked-out-of-ncaa-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-11/mens-tennis-knocked-out-of-ncaa-tournament/","id":132,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[131,130,129],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles","biography":"Not available","articles":[78,81,85,86,101,103,108,110,111,113,115,116,120,122,125,127,129,130,132,140,141,142,145,148,151,156,160,161,165,180,181,448,523,584,627,924,925,927,957,958,960,978,980,1008,1010,1011,1012,1015,1026,1027,1030,1031,1036,1047,1049,1050,1073,1082,1084,1089,1766,1770,1771,1987,1989,1997,2019,2026,2027,2034,3288,3297],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Men’s Tennis Claims Second Big West Title in Three Years","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB took down UC Irvine 4-3 to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62805\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.1-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1751242911\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62817\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62805\" data-attachment-id=\"62805\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/mens-tennis-claims-second-big-west-title-in-three-years/ziad-sultan-hits-the-ball-towards-his-opponent-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ChristinaDeMarzo_MensTennis4.18.1-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Ziad Sultan hits the ball towards his opponent.

The Gauchos defeated both Hawaii and UC Davis to make it to the final, where they topped UC Irvine 4-3 to hoist the trophy.</p>\n<p>With three wins in the tournament, Santa Barbara improves to an overall record of 15-9 and extends its win streak to four straight.</p>\n<p>The first match of the tournament for the three-seeded Gauchos came against the sixth-seeded Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. Earlier in the regular season, Santa Barbara downed Hawaii at home 6-1, and on this past Thursday, it put on a similar performance. The Gauchos took a 4-0 victory and play was stopped for resting purposes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos started off the day battling with the Warriors in the doubles point. Hawaii grabbed a quick win on court three and needed just one more doubles victory to go up 1-0. The senior duo of Ziad Sultan and Tobias Galskov evened the score up with their 6-3 victory on court two. The Gauchos were then able to capture the doubles point with a 6-4 win on the number one court by junior Nathan Eshmade and sophomore Erik Johnsson.</p>\n<p>With a 1-0 victory, the Gauchos moved on to the singles round and took three straight set victories on the lower courts to seal the 4-0 win. On court four, freshman Cody Rakela took a 6-3, 6-4 victory and Johnsson finished with the same score on court five. Sophomore Teague Hamilton took the last win with ease 6-1, 6-1 on court six. With this win, the Gauchos looked ahead to a rematch with second-seeded UC Davis.</p>\n<p>The Aggies beat out the Gauchos in their regular season matchup just a few weeks ago by a close score of 4-3 in Davis. The story was much different this time around when the two teams met at in this neutral setting, and Santa Barbara took a 4-1 win to advance to the final round.</p>\n<p>In the doubles round, UCSB once again showed its dominance as all three doubles teams held leads, and the wins came down to who could finish first. The duo of Eshmade and Johnsson added a 6-3 win and a 6-4 victory from sophomore Morgan Mays and junior Andrew Riminton sealed the point. Galskova and Sultan were stopped with a 5-4 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos again took some help from their players on the lower courts when they headed into the singles round. Hamilton and Johnsson added victories for the second straight day to put their team up 3-0 over the Aggies. Hamilton won 6-2, 7-6 on court six and Johnsson triumphed in three sets on court five 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.</p>\n<p>Galskov, reclaiming his spot on court one, ended the match and sent his team to final round to take on the first seeded UC Irvine Anteaters with a straight set win of 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p>In the final match of the Big West Tournament, UCSB would again get a chance to beat a team that downed them during the regular season by the close score of 4-3. The Gauchos got their revenge, delivering the Eaters a 4-3 loss and bringing the Big West title back to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started off the finals match just as they had done the previous two, with a win in the doubles round. Eshmade and Johnsson grabbed the first match easily on court one with a score of 6-2, but the Eaters were able to take away the match on court three. The senior captains, Sultan and Galskov, came through for their team with a 6-4 win that put UCSB up 1-0.</p>\n<p>Singles play faired the Gauchos in the earlier part of the day as the team quickly took control of match. Freshman Cody Rakela added his second singles win of the tournament in straight sets of 7-6, 6-4 on court four. Johnsson fell early losing his first set 6-0, but battled back to win the next two 6-2, 6-3 on court five. These two wins put the team up 3-0 and the victory seemed inevitable.</p>\n<p>With just one more win needed, the Gauchos dropped singles matches on courts one, three, and six, and Irvine was right back in the game tying the score at 3-3. The match and the title came down to Eshmade playing on court two. The junior from Australia was downed 6-7 in the first set and needed the next two to win the tournament for his team. He kept himself alive winning the second set 6-4 and sealed history UCSB winning the third and final set 6-3.</p>\n<p>UCSB took home its second tournament title in just three years and grabbed its ninth in school history. With this accomplishment, the Gauchos will be heading to the NCAA tournament May 8th. Seeding is yet to be decided.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62817\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/mens-tennis-claims-second-big-west-title-in-three-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62817\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/mens-tennis-claims-second-big-west-title-in-three-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/mens-tennis-claims-second-big-west-title-in-three-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/mens-tennis-claims-second-big-west-title-in-three-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-27/mens-tennis-claims-second-big-west-title-in-three-years/","id":129,"author":{"id":69,"name":"Daniel Moebus-Bowles"},"related":[128,127,126],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Remains Undefeated at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos handed losses to New Mexico State and UC Riverside to improve to a perfect 8-0 at home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62018\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1012506095\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62037\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62018\" data-attachment-id=\"62018\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/mens-tennis-remains-undefeated-at-home/morgan-mays-gets-ready-to-return-the-ball-sam-aragondaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150308_mens_tennis_vsGonzaga_04-web.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.8\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Morgan Mays gets ready to return the ball.

Johnsson has personally thrived on his home courts as well, only losing one singles match at home this season.</p>\n<p>The match with New Mexico State was ultimately decided by the doubles point, which the Gauchos won to start off the match 2-1. The team of senior Ziad Sultan and sophomore Teague Hamilton took the first victory 6-1 to put the team one win away from the first point. The duo of Johnsson and junior Nathan Eshmade sealed the deal with a 6-2 victory that put the Gauchos up 1-0.</p>\n<p>The singles matches were split right the down the middle 3-3 which gave the Gauchos a 4-3 win overall. Among the Gauchos who were able to grab a singles victory was Eshmade, playing in the number one spot for the first time this season. Just a few weeks prior to this match he was commonly filling the third and fourth spot, but has stepped up for his team winning every match since early February. The junior did not disappoint by any means as he was able to take a straight set win 6-1, 6-1.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been playing some unbelievable volley tennis lately and Coach has really been noticing it,” Eshmade explained. “Guys haven’t been able to handle it lately, and I’ve been able to really build on top of my game as I go through this season.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore Morgan Mays added a second victory for UCSB on court three. Mays struggled early on the first set as he fell behind 2-0, but was able to bounce back and take the set 6-3. The second set was even closer as Mays had to win in with a tiebreaker, 7-5.</p>\n<p>Hamilton was another Gaucho to take a singles victory with his straight set victory. He took an easy win in the first set 6-3 and then was forced to a tie-breaker in the second. Hamilton battled his way to a 7-6 victory which clinched the win for the Gauchos in this match.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s match with conference opponent UC Riverside was much more one-sided, but, nonetheless, important for UCSB which came in with a 1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The team started off the same way as they did Saturday, taking the all-important doubles point. The same teams would be responsible as well with a victory 6-2 from Sultan and Hamilton and a 6-1 win from Eshmade and Johnsson.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been really working on our doubles play lately, and it’s starting to get really strong,” junior Andrew Riminton said. “You can see how much we’ve improved from prior matches and we’re looking really solid right now on that end.”</p>\n<p>Riminton himself, alongside partner Mays, battled in both of their doubles matches this weekend. Although they were stopped early in both outings, they were handedly winning both matches and were even close to match point just before their teammates finished.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were able to win five of their six singles matches against the Highlanders including Johnsson’s impressive win on court four. The sophomore stole the first set away from his opponent, sweeping him 6-0. He nearly repeated this performance as he went up 5-0 in the second set, but then was forced to fight for a 6-2 win. He was the first Gaucho to finish and put his team up 2-0.</p>\n<p>Eshmade and Mays followed Johnsson’s example on courts one and two and took straight set victories as well with scores of 6-4, 6-3, and 6-3, 6-1, respectively. Riminton held down court six, playing singles for the first time since February and winning 6-2, 6-2. Freshman Cody Rakela bounced back from his loss on Saturday and took a three set win 6-0, 1-6, 6-4 to give the team its 6-1 overall win.</p>\n<p>The team will now head on the road to face UC Davis, University of the Pacific and Fresno State in three consecutive matches starting this Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Everyone had high hopes for Boston, as they just acquired two big all-stars in Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving.</p>\n<p>But in the blink of an eye, about six minutes into the game, Hayward went down with a gruesome left leg injury that would require surgery and render him out of commission for the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p>After losing Hayward early in the season and later losing Kyrie Irving, who had surgery to remove prior placed screws in his left patella, the sports world was in awe of what happened next.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Almost no one expected the Celtics to go as far as they did in the playoffs. Taking an explosive Milwaukee team to 7 games, beating a stacked Philly team in just 5, and taking LeBron James and his cradled Cavs to an eventful Eastern Conference Finals game 7.</p>\n<p>The Celts saw their season slip through their hands in the last few minutes of that game 7, when LeBron took over and the team couldn’t hit a shot to save their lives.</p>\n<p>But despite coming up short in the 2017-2018 season, what lies ahead of this Boston team is perhaps a brighter future than any other franchise in the NBA.</p>\n<p>The Celtics will be legitimate title contenders for years to come, and here’s why…</p>\n<p>Not only do the Celtics have a General Manger mastermind in Danny Ainge (trading the number one pick to obtain Jayson Tatum <em>and</em> a subsequent first rounder?! Amazing!). But they also have the second coming of Greg Popovich in coach Brad Stevens, they’re loaded with young talent, and since acquiring Hayward and Irving, they are no doubt an enticing location for any free agent serious about winning some hardware.</p>\n<p>In order to fully understand the firepower of Boston, it is quintessential to look at the antecedent state of their roster in which they ended their season, understand just what the Celtics have to look forward to in their future draft picks, and take note of what they will look like come training camp when No.11 and No. 20 suit-up once again.</p>\n<p>In terms of their draft picks, let’s take a look at what the Green Machine has in their arsenal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Celts are in complete ownership of all of their first-round picks going forward. For this year’s upcoming draft, Boston sits at No. 27 overall, barring any trades they may choose to engage in.</li>\n<li>Remember the trade heard ‘round the world? When Ainge deciphered that he could get the same person at No. 3 in the 2017 draft that he could get at No. 1? Remember when everyone said Philly “won” that trade that got them Markelle Fultz? The same Fultz who got to watch the NBA Playoffs the same way the rest of us did – without stepping on the court…? Well, because of Ainge’s gutsy call, the C’s earned the Sacramento Kings’ first round pick in 2019, by way of trade with the 76ers.</li>\n<li>Boston will get the L.A. Clippers’ first round pick in 2019 if it ends up being No. 15 or later, as selections 1 to 14 are protected. If the Celtics don’t end up getting the pick in 2019, then it reverts to a 2020 pick, under same restrictions as the one in 2019. Consequently, if the Celtics don’t get that L.A. pick in 2020, then they will receive the Clippers’ 2022 second round pick.</li>\n<li>Memphis’ first round pick in 2019 will go to the C’s if it turns out to be No. 9 or later. But if that doesn’t go Boston’s way, then in 2020 if the Grizzlies’ selection is No. 7 or later, that pick will go straight to Boston. If those two scenarios don’t lean in Boston’s favor, then the Celtics will receive the Grizzlies’ first round pick in 2021 with no restrictions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is clear that the Celts have more than a couple draft picks up their sleeve. It cannot be ignored though, that draft picks are only as good as the players the franchise chooses to pick up. But given Boston’s track record of successful drafting, that doesn’t seem to be something the C’s are too worried about.</p>\n<p>Boston’s current roster impressed many, by getting within one game of the NBA Finals without their two all-stars.</p>\n<p>Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Jayson Tatum, and their coach Brad Stevens, are just a few reasons why.</p>\n<p>You would have been a fool to think an offensive powerhouse like Tatum would’ve been anything less than effective this past season. After all, he did come from Duke. However, not many foresaw him developing as much as he did as fast as he did.</p>\n<p>With Hayward going down, it forced Tatum to step up and grow into the force he is inevitably becoming before our very eyes. He effectively plays both ends of the court, and even got a highlight-worthy dunk on LeBron James late in his rookie season.</p>\n<p>20-year old Tatum may not be able to get into a bar just yet, but he’s already got into the hearts of every Celtic fan around the world. Tatum is just a piece of the puzzle that makes up the future of the C’s franchise.</p>\n<p>Boston is extremely versatile, and their roster is loaded with pieces that just “fit”. You’ve got players from the veteran Al Horford, who is a critical piece of the Celtics’ frontcourt and leadership, to the young and explosive dunk-machine Jaylen Brown who is also a force on defense.</p>\n<p>You’d be remiss not to consider Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Marcus Smart, and the other competitors that played a big role in the Celts’ great playoff run. But you can contend that a few of those pieces are somewhat disposable if you’re owner Wyc Grousbeck and GM Danny Ainge and are looking to acquire other players.</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that the Celtics may be considering trading Brown and some picks to move up in the draft to gain a shot at big Center Mo Bamba from the University of Texas. But if you know anything about Ainge, these rumors can possibly prove to be nothing but smoke and mirrors, especially since the C’s didn’t trade down in the draft last year until the very last possible second and shocked the world by trading for the third overall pick.</p>\n<p>Brad Stevens has a coaching system that mimics the great Bill Belichick’s, and that became abundantly evident this past season.</p>\n<p>The “next man up” approach the Celtics have adapted is similar to what the New England Patriots refer to as “Do Your Job”, meaning that every player on the roster needs to be ready to come to play, no matter the game or the week.</p>\n<p>Stevens was such a big influence and genius play-caller with the young injury-induced roster he had this past season, so one can only imagine what his greatness can achieve in several years to come with a fully healthy roster.</p>\n<p>Looking at the final minutes of the ECF game 7, and the struggles Boston had scoring, it is evident that Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward are much needed and will have a huge impact once healthy and can push this already good team to become a great one.</p>\n<p>One can’t know for sure, but if those two all-stars were on the roster, some say we would have been watching a very different NBA Finals right now instead of watching Steph Curry and Klay Thompson run circles around JR Smith and Tristan Kardashian (I had to).</p>\n<p>When you consider the current pieces they have, the pending state of the team when Hayward and Irving come back, and the vast amount of picks the Celts have at their disposal, you can easily proclaim that Boston clearly has the best “process” around. And that process didn’t even involve tanking (looking at you, Philly).</p>\n<p>With LeBron’s future in Cleveland hanging in the balance, you could attest that Boston and Philadelphia might be the best two teams in the East starting next season. But even if LeBron does stay in the East, he definitely won’t have an automatic bid to the Finals like he’s had these past 8 years. These ain’t your mommas Boston Celtics, folks. This team is for real.</p>\n<p>The Celtics are set up to win for years to come.</p>\n<p>Who knows? They may even win not 1… not 2… not 3… not 4… not 5…</p>\n<p>On second thought, the last person to make that prognostication ended up getting that amount of NBA Finals losses instead of titles.</p>\n<p>Boston has a bright future ahead of them, they can let their upcoming success speak for itself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/","id":131,"author":{"id":47,"name":"Kendra Jackson"},"related":[130,129,128],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
