Monday for the After Tahrir: Egyptian Revolutionary Experiences and Future Visions conference in the McCune Conference Room.</p>\n<p>The four-day conference, organized by UCSB Professors Paul Amar, Sherene Seikaly and Laila Shereen Sakr, featured journalists, activists, artists and professors who spoke about the worldwide impact of the Revolution and how the Egyptian public continues to grapple with its implications. Many of the speakers have witnessed and experienced tragedy and violence, but use their narratives as tools to mobilize change and hold their oppressors accountable, whether through the media, art or memory.</p>\n<p>During Monday’s first panel, Egyptian visual artist Heba Amin spoke about how she and other Egyptians were “caught between hope and despair” during the time of the Revolution, which continues in an ongoing narrative.</p>\n<p>“The sense of possibility was real, or at least that’s how I remember it,” Amin said. “The past must become part of our present.”</p>\n<p>Amin also spoke about how technology was a key factor in the Revolution, as it allowed people to mobilize. Even though the Internet was shut down for almost a week, Amin said the “sentiment that people wanted to preserve their voice for eternity” persevered and started a worldwide discussion.</p>\n<p>The next panelist, curator Sarah Rifky, said the revolution was a way to show the government that its oppression and corruption cannot “fool” the people with “empty promises and sweet talk” and said “patience has its limit.”</p>\n<p>Although Rifky felt out of hope, support and imagination in some moments, she said art spaces pose a threat to the agenda of the government, and even art’s “imaginary conception of what it is and does” is extremely powerful.</p>\n<p>Each activist emphasized that the Egyptian Revolution led to a movement of “global solidarity” that can be related to movements all over the world such as Black Lives Matter and protests throughout Libya, Syria and Yemen.</p>\n<p>Journalist and blogger Wael Eskandar spoke about how one’s memory can serve as a weapon in the face of revolution.</p>\n<p>“The story needs to be told and there is more of the story to be told,” Eskandar said. “To be part of the Revolution is not primarily an Egyptian thing … the narrative is global.”</p>\n<p>Eskandar said the Revolution will endure through memories as a “moral stance.”</p>\n<p>“[The revolution] is neither dead, nor triumphant — it continues,” Eskandar said.</p>\n<p>According to Eskandar, many Egyptians “cannot forget the blood,” and memories of the protests will stay with them.</p>\n<p>“People feel a responsibility to what they’ve witnessed,” Eskandar said.</p>\n<p>Eskandar said Egyptians must use this memory to move forward and use it as a resource against those trying to rewrite the narrative of not only the Egyptian public, but also activists everywhere.</p>\n<p>“Today, there are pockets of resistance through memory,” Eskandar said. “It gives us the opportunity to be keepers of the flame.”</p>\n<p>Dalia Abd El Hameed, Head of the Gender Program at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said she believes the sentiments of the revolution encourage solidarity.</p>\n<p>“[The narrative is about] confronting the silence together,” Hameed said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Santa Barbara this quarter.</p>\n<p>The graduate seminar meets in a small classroom in the Humanities and Social Sciences Building and is intended for a maximum of 25 students. Yet, even as the university heads into its third week of the Winter Quarter, there are not enough chairs in the room for all of the fascinated students.</p>\n<p>While Analytic Number Theory may not be what attracts these students, the professor, Dr. Yitang Zhang, does.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably, at this point, one of the most famous mathematicians in the world,” Jeffrey Stopple, UCSB mathematics professor, told the Nexus when Zhang was hired in September. “I think there might be only maybe two or three others alive that have his level of celebrity.”</p>\n<p>Zhang gained fame amongst mathematicians in 2013 after submitting a proof to the Annals of Mathematics, establishing the first finite bound on gaps between twin prime numbers and thus solving the Twin Prime Conjecture, a 150-year-old math problem. At the time, he was working as a part-time calculus teacher at the University of New Hampshire and gained instant recognition, winning a MacArthur Award in 2014, and was promoted to full professorship.</p>\n<p>Zhang’s accomplishment also made its way to the silver screen. The New York Times reported Zhang’s breakthrough a month after his submission, and filmmaker George Csicsery made Zhang the subject of 2015 documentary “Counting from Infinity.”</p>\n<p>Garo Sarajian, a mathematics graduate student at UCSB, said he noticed that people outside of the math world were beginning to recognize Zhang’s name.</p>\n<p>Sarajian said he struck up a conversation with a “random economics student” next to him on the bus, and was surprised that he had already heard of Zhang.</p>\n<p>“Of course I know [Zhang] is a big deal, but I had no idea how big of a deal he was outside the department,” Sarajian said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s math department announced Zhang’s hiring in September. Zhang currently spends much of his time teaching one very popular, overcrowded graduate seminar and conducting further research into number theory.</p>\n<p>“The department did not ask me to teach so much, but I will at times,” Zhang said. “It’s more research time.”</p>\n<p>Zhang said he decided to accept an offer from Chancellor Henry T. Yang in the summer after he was recommended by Harvard University mathematics professor Shing-Tung Yau.</p>\n<p>“I got an email from Professor Yau and, very quickly, I said, ‘Yes I would like to do that,’” Zhang said.</p>\n<p>Zhang remarks that the “feeling” and environment in Santa Barbara is “very different” from New Hampshire. He said he especially enjoys the view of the Santa Ynez Mountains from his office on the sixth floor of South Hall.</p>\n<p>“On a sunny day, you can see the mountain very clearly,” Zhang said. “I really love it here. I will use the good environment to try to do something more.”</p>\n<p>When he is not teaching or researching, Zhang walks around campus and on the beach. Sarajian said Zhang will strike up small conversations with many of the people he passes.</p>\n<p>“He’s very friendly and very approachable,” Sarajian said. “If you didn’t know who he is, you’d think he’s just another very friendly professor.”</p>\n<p>Sarajian, who attends Zhang’s Analytic Number Theory seminar, said Zhang possesses a remarkable ability to engage with his students, whether it be frequently joking with the class or providing insight.</p>\n<p>“He’s not only good at teaching but also at getting [students] excited about what he’s teaching as well,” Sarajian said. “When someone in his position is able to do that, it’s a big deal.”</p>\n<p>Mathematics graduate student Nicolas Brody said Zhang is energetic but modest.</p>\n<p>“However great his achievements, he is a remarkably humble man, and in his Analytic Number Theory course this quarter, he is a very expressive and energetic professor,” Brody said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang said having an “exceptionally dedicated” teacher and mathematician like Zhang on campus boosts the university’s status.</p>\n<p>“His renowned research and scholarship elevate the proud reputation of our university, and now that he is here in the classroom, our students and their education will directly benefit from his brilliance,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Sarajian said he thinks Zhang’s presence will add prestige to the university and attract more students to the program.</p>\n<p>“The school has a celebrity professor we can brag about,” Sarajian said. “It’s amazing how one person does make a difference.”</p>\n<p>Zhang said he hopes to stay at UCSB until his eventual retirement.</p>\n<p>Despite all of his achievements, Zhang said he does not believe he has yet reached the pinnacle of his career.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to keep going up,” Zhang said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The panel discussed the consequences and possible future solutions of the money given to these Political Action Committees (PACs) that are allegedly independent from the candidates they support.</p>\n<p>City council member Gregg Hart said people cannot expect elected officials at every level of government to be looking out for citizens’ best interests, and said citizens should be as knowledgeable as possible about information on social media and television.</p>\n<p>“Education and engagement of citizens at a much more fundamental level about government is really the answer,” Hart said. “It is impossible today to be a passive citizen to have an effect.”</p>\n<p>Hart said oftentimes factions arise that campaign only to their voters, resulting in many opinions getting lost through censorship.</p>\n<p>“As we are overloaded with information, we are censoring ourselves; we are selecting the information we are trying to sort through and to find value in,” Hart said. “In doing that, we are not hearing other people’s perspectives.”</p>\n<p>According to Hart, the amount of money given to political campaigns should not be a deciding factor for voters who have taken the time to learn about the issues and candidates.</p>\n<p>“An uninformed voter [shouldn’t be] persuaded by a goofy television ad that was funded by a corporation,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Jared Daniels, fourth-year political science and history double major and Associated Students external vice president of statewide affairs voter registration director, said the problem is not only within the Executive and Legislative branches, but is in the Judicial branch as well.</p>\n<p>“Citizens United has created an entire generation of Justices which highly benefit from Citizens United, and that all carry on with them throughout their Judicial career,” Daniels said. “So to me, the influence of money and what should be the most nonpartisan, un-ideological branch of government is also subject to the exorbitant amount of funds that are in politics today.”</p>\n<p>Political science professor Eric Smith said the main issue in campaigns is inequality between economic statuses.</p>\n<p>“There has been a huge transfer, bigger than any in this nation’s history, of money from working class, middle class people, to the corporations and the extremely rich are soaking up huge amounts of it and it comes out in public policy,” Smith said. “The cost of going to school or the cost of health insurance that we pay, a whole bunch of policies turn on inequality, and we are all suffering.”</p>\n<p>Smith said one solution could be to give the power to regulate campaign finances back to Congress and state legislatures.</p>\n<p>“If you want to do something about inequality, this would be a huge first step,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Hart said there is a distorted democracy and figuring out ways to work around the existing system of campaigns is unimaginably hard.</p>\n<p>“Changing Citizens United is only a step in that process … there are many other loopholes,” Hart said. “There is so much money at stake in this sort of equation.”</p>\n<p>Hart said the influence of money between Democratic and Republican funded campaigns is “dramatically different.”</p>\n<p>“The judges of the Supreme Court who passed Citizens United [and] who are constantly ruling in ways that protect corporate influence and disadvantage regular people are the Republicans,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Daniels said where the funding is coming from plays a large part in where it is delegated.</p>\n<p>“We have to look that this also includes union money,” Daniels said. “Union money is a factor [which] would by and large benefit the Democratic Party. So of course there is always going to be that question: ‘Does money really affect the voting behavior of elected representatives?’”</p>\n<p>Ezinne Meremikwu, Against Citizens United campaign coordinator at CALPIRG, said CALPRIG is gathering local support to end the corporate funding of elections.</p>\n<p>“We are actually working with the Santa Barbara City Council to basically get Santa Barbara to put themselves on record on being against Citizens United,” Meremikwu said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67571\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/calpirg-hosts-panel-to-discuss-citizens-united/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67571\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/calpirg-hosts-panel-to-discuss-citizens-united/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/calpirg-hosts-panel-to-discuss-citizens-united/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/calpirg-hosts-panel-to-discuss-citizens-united/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-22/calpirg-hosts-panel-to-discuss-citizens-united/","id":2557,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2556,2555,2554],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
