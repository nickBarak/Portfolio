Team</em></p></div>\n<p>A second-year UC Santa Barbara student passed away Friday in a hospital after attempting to take his own life two days before.</p>\n<p>Hayden Werner, pre-biology major and honors student, was actively involved in the Snow Team during his time at UCSB and was set to lead the group as an officer next year.</p>\n<p>Shoshana Cohen, recent UCSB graduate, was Werner’s teammate and said she saw him as a “little brother,” watching him transition through his first and second year of college.</p>\n<p>“He went from an average skier … into a skier who really put it upon himself to go up to Mammoth [Mountain] and make it his life in the winter,” Cohen said. By his second year, she said Werner was a “top part of the team.”</p>\n<p>Along with other members of the team, Cohen and Werner would frequently drive up to Mammoth Mountain for skiing and snowboarding excursions. These trips created memories to last a lifetime, Cohen said, and made their friendship of two years feel like much longer.</p>\n<p>“For me, the favorite parts were the car rides up to Mammoth,” she said. “Just being in that car, and freestyle rapping up the 395, the entire way … it wouldn’t matter how late we got to Mammoth.”</p>\n<p>Cohen said Werner’s friends came together in Isla Vista after his passing to heal and celebrate his life, finding closure by remembering his influence upon their lives.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing that Hayden taught me was to have gratitude and to really recognize all the beauty that surrounds you in life,” Cohen said. “It’s not like I’m moving on, I’m moving forward. I will always have a piece of Hayden with me.”</p>\n<p>Werner was also a lifeguard in Orange County and an avid surfer, according to an email sent on Tuesday by Katya Armistead, the dean of student life.</p>\n<p>The Orange County lifeguards have arranged a sunset paddle-out at 6:30 p.m. on May 30 at Dana Strand Beach in Dana Point.</p>\n<p>A memorial service will be held for Hayden on May 31, at 11 a.m. at the Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Students who are in need of mental health support can contact Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) at </em></strong><a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu/\"><strong><em>caps.sa.ucsb.edu</em></strong></a><strong><em> or 805-893-4411.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>[Correction: Dana Strand Beach is in Dana Point, not Oxnard.]</em></p>\n<p><em>[Correction: The article initially said that the student attempted to take his life one day before Friday, he made the attempt two days before on Wednesday.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/second-year-student-passes-away-at-19/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/second-year-student-passes-away-at-19/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/second-year-student-passes-away-at-19/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/second-year-student-passes-away-at-19/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/second-year-student-passes-away-at-19/","id":2484,"author":{"id":91,"name":"Supriya Yelimeli"},"related":[2483,2482,2481],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Capps Donates 20 Years of Documents to Library","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capps-Featured-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capps-Featured-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lois Capps, former congresswoman for the United States who retired in November, has donated 20 years’ worth of documents to the UC Santa Barbara Library’s Special Research Collections.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Lois Capps, former congresswoman for the United States who retired in November, has donated 20 years’ worth of documents to the UC Santa Barbara Library’s Special Research Collections.</p>\n<p>Curated from Capps’ long history in Santa Barbara, the documents will be located on the third floor of the UCSB Library’s Mountain Side.</p>\n<p>“I never entertained any other library as a possibility,” Capps said in an interview with the Nexus on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The collection includes letters from Capps’ constituents and several awards selected by Danelle Moon, the head of the Special Research Collections. Moon reached out to Capps and began collaborating on the records transfer last fall. The remaining awards will be digitally represented within the collection.</p>\n<p>In a statement released Tuesday, Capps said one of her easier decisions was to donate her official papers to UCSB, while her decision to retire was “a hard one.” “This fantastic school has played such an important part in my family’s life,” she stated.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB Library is honored to preserve and manage former Congresswoman Lois Capps’ papers, which will support generations of students and scholars interested in her 20 years of leadership and service,” UCSB Librarian Denise Stephens said in a press release.<br>\n“We are deeply grateful to Lois Capps for this gift, which will help advance UCSB Library as a destination for research on California history and politics,” the release read.</p>\n<p>Capps, who said she believes “pretty strongly that we have an open and transparent government,” is glad that the collection can be used and “not just stored away in musty boxes somewhere.” Capps redacted personal information to ensure that individuals’ privacy would not be violated.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the material is really very paper oriented, before 2002, before everything went totally digital, so there’s a lot of interesting scrapbooks about her time in office, you know, her calendars, all of the legislation she was involved with,” Moon said on Wednesday “This is kind of an eclectic representation.”</p>\n<p>Capps donated around 130 boxes worth of material, which Moon estimates will take about six months to categorize.</p>\n<p>UCSB librarians will survey the collection to determine its contents, formats and special preservation requirements. They will then arrange and describe the collection for public access.</p>\n<p>“Some things will need special preservation depending how old it is,” Beaudry Allen, who will be processing the collection, said.</p>\n<p>Once librarians process the collection, students will be allowed to use the documents for research. They must request the documents in advance from the Department of Special Research Collections and view them in a specific room where no food, drinks or backpacks are allowed. Students also are not allowed to use pen or take any flash photography because of the nature of the documents, some of which are irreplaceable.</p>\n<p>Moon also hopes to raise funds to offset processing costs. The department receives around $100,000 per year just for the materials needed to preserve collections. This doesn’t include wages or other costs.</p>\n<p>The collection will become part of the growing number of political papers at UCSB, which also include records from former assemblymember Das Williams, former California legislator John Vasconcellos and Ronald Reagan’s biographer Lou Cannon.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>A guest speaker for the UCSB Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) on Wednesday spoke against commonly held beliefs regarding sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Guest Speaker Andrew Cavarno, a fourth-year history major and member of Young Americans for Liberty, argued that a frequently referenced statistic of one in four women being sexually assaulted on college campuses is heavily inflated and lacking in evidence.</p>\n<p>“There is absolutely no evidence of a rape epidemic on college campuses,” Cavarno said. “The word epidemic implies that there’s a sudden wave of sexual violence, or that things are getting worse – this is just not the case.”</p>\n<p>YAL originally intended the event to be a panel discussion featuring speakers from differing sides of the argument. Pointing to an empty chair beside him, Cavarno emphasized that no one with an opposing view was present to make the case for the statistic, even after having sent out “hundreds of emails.”</p>\n<p>“Why is that chair empty?” Cavarno asked, “If all the evidence is truly on that side, if it is beyond reproach, if there’s no reason to debate this, then why is this chair empty?”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that while sexual assault on campuses is an important issue, the current system infringes upon due process rights.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of the numbers, we still have to have a system that works,” Cavarno said. “Regardless of whether its one in five or one in 50, we still need a system that allows survivors to receive support but also a system that does not infringe on the due process rights of accused students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There is absolutely no evidence of a rape epidemic on college campuses.” — Andrew Cavarno</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cavarno criticized a study conducted by the Association of American Universities, stating that it had a sample with an “extraordinarily low response rate” and an “over-broad definition of sexual assault.” He also argued that the study does not distinguish between acts of sexual assault and acts of sexual battery.</p>\n<p>“Both sexual assault and sexual battery are inexcusable, but they are not the same kind of action,” Cavarno said. “The one in five statistic on the other hand uses definitions that fail to distinguish between a girl getting her ass grabbed at a party and being forcibly penetrated, or having someone have sex with her when she is incapacitated.”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that the way schools handle sexual assault often ruins the careers and social lives of men by unfairly branding them as rapists. Cavarno then wrapped up his speech saying “feminism teaches the notion that men are not deserving of empathy,” concluding that “schools should not adjudicate sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>James Cornell, fourth-year electrical engineering major and Vice President of Young Americans for Liberty, said the speech was “very factual and academic.”</p>\n<p>“I think [the statistic] paints a very bad image of males in society and males on college campuses,” Cornell said. “It instills a lot of fear into women so they don’t feel safe on college campuses where they should be.”</p>\n<p>Katia Stern, a second-year financial math and statistics major, said that inflated statistics devalue the instances of more heinous cases of rape.</p>\n<p>“I think if the statistic is over-exaggerated it sort of devalues the worst cases of the rape, and it makes it seem like it’s a lot more prevalent and we start to consider really minor accusations in the compass of the broader definition of rape,” Stern said. “It kind of diminishes the value of individuals who are brutally raped.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a first-year anthropology major, who asked to remain anonymous, said universities should support victims of  sexual assault by providing programs like Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (CARE) and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that it’s wrong for universities to be involved in advocating for victims of sexual assault,” she said. “I was sexually assaulted as a minor and I feel like the system that I had before university has utterly failed me, and I feel like it’s very important to have CARE and CAPs and for this university to be very strict on people who are accused.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71213\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71213\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-20/ucsb-group-questions-validity-of-campus-rape-statistics/","id":2483,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2482,2481,2480],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
