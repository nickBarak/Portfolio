Zalesky detailed the incidence of MST compared to civilians and discussed stark similarities and contrasts between sexual assault in the military and in civilian life. About a dozen students, primarily interns in the CARE advocacy office, attended the lecture.</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, there is a parallel between sexual assault at universities and within the military. According to Zaleski, one in two women and one in 12 men experience MST in the course of their service.</p>\n<p>“When you are in a Greek system or university system you have your own reporting process,” Zalesky said. “You have your own police department you have your own way of tracking sexual trauma and you have a culture in which you are kind of confined, and when we’re talking about the military, we’re talking about that in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky said the military and UC face similar difficulties in addressing sexual assault, and neither are particularly effective.</p>\n<p>“[UC system’s framework] rarely results in a conviction of the assailant and it’s also true for the military,” Zalesky said. “This university culture, it’s not that different from someone who is 18 and chooses military service, in terms of the sexual boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the common ideas surrounding how sexual assault occurs usually do not match reality.</p>\n<p>“These are the typical assumptions we make about sexual assault: it’s a random guy in a dark alley; it’s someone we don’t know; they have a weapon,” Zalesky said. “Most often, people who are raped are raped by somebody they have a trusting relationship with — it’s a family member, it’s a boyfriend, it’s an ex-boyfriend, it’s a best friend.”</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, this difference between the idea of a typical perpetrators and the reality of who they usually are makes reporting more difficult.</p>\n<p>“That’s why when you look at rape reports it’s so hard to get somebody to report because it wasn’t so clear. He wasn’t wearing a mask in a dark alley as a stranger with a knife right? It was your best friend who you’ve partied with for a year and a half,” Zalesky said. “The reason that we hesitate to report sexual assaults is because we’re so confused because it doesn’t match up with the construct of what we imagined.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said those in the armed forces who report are typically required to stay in service, as leave for survivors is not granted most of the time, which makes avoiding assailants virtually impossible. For this and other reasons, sexual assault survivors in the military have fewer options than their civilian counterparts, Zalesky said.</p>\n<p>“From day one this is your brother, this is your sister right? We are a military family,” Zalesky said. “Even if you want to take time off, even if you want to go see your mom, you can’t because you signed this [enlistment] contract.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the number of male survivors of MST are roughly equal to the number of female survivors — just over 300,000 survivors of both genders — but males are far less likely to report than females.</p>\n<p>“Men are being brutalized as often during military service, but women come forward and it’s more socially acceptable to be a woman that’s been raped than a man that’s been raped … we have an epidemic of men who aren’t talking about their sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky closed with a brief discussion on advocacy and how to help survivors, followed by a question and answer session with the audience. Zalesky said a more effective strategy for combating MST is not necessarily to encourage women to “not get raped” but rather encourage a culture of bystander intervention.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and feminist studies double major Clair Breen said student engagement in issues related to MST is important for continuing advocacy on the problem.</p>\n<p>“I think anything we can do is awesome, especially as college students,” Breen said. “Advocacy work is hard though because it’s hard to see a difference.”</p>\n<p>Breen also said her main take-away from the presentation was related to the difficulties MST survivors face in addressing their assaults.</p>\n<p>“I took away that it’s very hard to report in the military — that it’s a really prevalent issue,” Breen said.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-63892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The ability to hold a memorial in this way for those lost last May is unique and deeply personal to the UCSB and Isla Vista community. Last year’s Paddle Out was hugely successful in helping many to find solace on the water and to recognize the hope and strength that comes from community. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Hundreds of UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents attended the second annual I.V. Memorial Paddle Out Wednesday evening at the beach north of Campus Point to commemorate the lives of the six students lost in the tragedy of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>UCSB Surf Team hosted the event with help from lifeguards and safety personnel who led attendees with boards and floatation devices into high tide. Onlookers who did not enter the water watched from the beach and surrounding cliffs as participants in the ocean formed a circle to symbolize solidarity, similar to the one formed a year ago.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the Paddle Out represents healing and is the “perfect ending” to the series of memorial events paying homage to the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“In my humble opinion, doing it in the ocean is, in itself, a healing and a cleansing act,” Jones said. “I think many community members that participated this evening intrinsically recognized the event.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year philosophy major and UCSB Surf Team member Alex Banks said the event was unique way to pay condolences to the students lost last year due to I.V.’s close proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“We have this beautiful ocean, and paddling out and surfing is a great way to pay respect to people that have passed away, regardless of the circumstances,” Banks said. “The fact that we have this resource is cool, and I think it’s a very inviting and serene atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Anne Trinh said she was not present during the events of May 23 last year, but still felt the Paddle Out strengthened the sense of community.</p>\n<p>“Being able to come out makes everyone feel like they are part of the community,” Trinh said. “So taking part in remembering those we lost, and recognizing what happened really allows us to come together, no matter how long you’ve been here.”</p>\n<p>Jones said the Paddle Out took on a “jubilant” atmosphere when people on the shore cheered for a couple’s pitbull wearing a life jacket struggling to stay on the surfboard while the couple tried to Paddle Out.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63894\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63894\" data-attachment-id=\"63894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/paddle-out-2015_by-lorenzo-basilio-web-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1125&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1125\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432751953\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Paddle Out/Sunset 2015\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63894\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was after everyone had started paddling out and they were trying to catch up,” Jones said. “But the waves started to kick up and they just couldn’t get the dog out there on the board. A wave would come over and knock him off the board and people would be like, ‘Oh no, oh no,’ and it was that kind of fun community vibe.”</p>\n<p>According to Banks, the presence of lifeguards, water patrol and emergency responders contributed to the sense of community for those participating in the event, because it showed solidarity between the county and local residents.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we got all these different agencies like the fire department and police to come out and watch over this event just promotes what we’re trying to do here even more,” Banks said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and Humans of UCSB Photographer Alex Nguyen said the event felt more optimistic and celebratory compared to last year’s Paddle Out, which focused on the community’s strength dealing with tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Last year’s Paddle Out was a reflection of what it means to be a Gaucho in the wake of a tragedy,” Nguyen said. “This year’s is more of a celebration of knowing what it means to be a Gaucho and the strength this community has gained over the last year.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the Paddle Out is symbolic of UCSB’s dedication to serving the environment and overcoming difficulties in light of the recent oil spill near Refugio.</p>\n<p>“There was discussion about whether or not it would affect the Paddle Out, which was planned months ago,” Jones said. “I think there’s also a consciousness about our environment, about the beauty of environment, about protecting our environment that is symbolized in the Paddle Out itself.”</p>\n<p>A version of this

Another world is possible.” The protest continued with presentations from event organizers demanding the UC divest from companies involved in oil spills and invest in students, followed by public comment from faculty, alumni and students on their frustration over the May 19 Refugio oil spill of over 100,000 gallons and the environmental damage caused by the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>Member of the California Students Sustainability Coalition and the Students Against Fracking campaign and UCSB alumnus Arlo Bender-Simon said he is frustrated the money he paid to the UC during his four years at UCSB is invested in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“The money that I have put into the UC system over the last four years is being invested into fossil fuel companies that continue to profit off of disastrous spills,” Bender-Simon said. “We really need to let our regents, our campus administration know it’s not ok for them to keep investing.”</p>\n<p>Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign Director for California Students Sustainability Coalition and UCSB alumna Emily Williams said the Refugio oil spill is not an isolated incident.</p>\n<p>“It’s a symptom; it’s just one piece of a much larger pattern that we see with the fossil-fuel-powered economy,” Williams said. “The root cause is this industry and, as it turns out, our university invests a lot of money in ExxonMobil, whose oil is being carried in Peabody [Energy] coal and a lot of these huge culprits. So we’re demanding that the university stop investing in these fuels and start investing in students, and start investing in our futures.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Academic Senate voted in favor of fossil fuel divestment in 2013 and Fossil Free UCSB is now working to gain Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s support of the movement, according to Williams.</p>\n<p>“On campus, we are really focusing on getting Chancellor Yang to come out and support his students and faculty, because all these different bodies have already come out in support of it,” Williams said. “We know we have the finances behind us, we know we have the morals behind us, let’s go back into negotiations and get this thing to happen.”</p>\n<p>Students Against Fracking Chair, Fossil Free UC and Environmental Affairs Board member and fourth-year global studies major Kiyomi De Zoysa said she views the recent spill as an opportunity for the community to change its opinion about investing in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“Especially at the UC, we’re complacent; we’re supporting Exxon, and Exxon’s product is what directly spilled into our environment,” De Zoysa said. “So we are directly invested in Exxon’s work. So, by that, we need to not be involved in it and make a political statement, social statement. It’s a moral imperative as the world’s greatest public institution.”</p>\n<p>Bender-Simon said Students Against Fracking aims to use the oil spill to mobilize students to participate in the movement to divest.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to figure out how we can really educate people about what fracking is, what steam injection is, what acidizing is, why we really don’t need to be doing all these newer, dirtier, more energy-intensive extraction techniques and why we need to move towards renewable energy,” Bender-Simon said.</p>\n<p>Williams said she believes discussions on whether the Paddle Out on Wednesday as part of the May 23 memorial events series should have been canceled because of the recent spill signify the importance of divesting from the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“The Paddle Out that was earlier [last] week, I think the fact that that beautiful ceremony was threatened by this oil spill also made people really realize, when we’re trying to come together as a community, there is this industry that’s blocking our way,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>De Zoysa said she was pleased with the turnout at the protest and hopes to see students continue to get involved in the campaign to divest.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised at how many people came out. Not just students, but a lot of influential activists on campus: John Foran and others,” De Zoysa said. “I was really happy and inspired to see people come up and speak their hearts and share information and how we can all get involved. I feel this momentum is building.”</p>\n<p>De Zoysa said she has seen an increase in the amount of student participation in environmental organizations on campus since the Refugio oil spill.</p>\n<p>“This event would not have had such a turnout if it weren’t for the oil spill,” De Zoisa said. “This is a great opportunity to reel as many people in as possible because they understand … animals are dying and washing up on shore and it’s really sad and it’s our fault. So we have a responsibility to make it right.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Pierce Abrahamson said he believes UCSB cannot claim to be one of the country’s top environmentally conscious universities when they are part of a system investing in the fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<p>“We as a school can say, ‘Oh, we’re environmental, we’re the greenest campus in the United States,’ but it doesn’t really mean much if we keep supporting the industry that is undermining the whole entire environmental movement to begin with,” Abrahamson said.</p>\n<p>Williams said any student who values the beach and ocean should think about participating with one of the many environmental groups on campus.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a campaign for financial experts. This isn’t a campaign for crazy radicals. This is a campaign for anyone who wants to have a livable future,” Williams said. “This is for anyone who thinks our beaches and oceans shouldn’t be filled with oil. So people should get involved … you don’t have to be an ‘activist’ to do it. This is not radical. This is very much something that is affecting us, and we need to make a change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/organizations-rally-to-support-fossil-fuel-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/organizations-rally-to-support-fossil-fuel-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/organizations-rally-to-support-fossil-fuel-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/organizations-rally-to-support-fossil-fuel-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/organizations-rally-to-support-fossil-fuel-divestment/","id":2730,"author":{"id":96,"name":"Megan Mineiro"},"related":[2729,2728,2727],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Storage Service To Assist On-Campus Residents","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/box-pack.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/box-pack.png?resize=658%2C502&ssl=1","description":"The student-run storage service company known as BoxCamp will offer summer storage and delivery for UC Santa Barbara students moving out of on-campus residence halls during the last two weeks of Sprin...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The student-run storage service company known as BoxCamp will offer summer storage and delivery for UC Santa Barbara students moving out of on-campus residence halls during the last two weeks of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>Second-year UC Los Angeles sociology student Keith Yoder founded BoxCamp, originally named Bruin Bins, last year as a freshman. After providing temporary summer storage for approximately 200 UCLA students last year, Yoder decided to expand his business to UCSB and rename it BoxCamp. The company provides students with boxes to pack their belongings in, which students then drop off at designated locations on campus. Boxes are stored for the entire summer and will be available for pick-up or can be delivered for a fee at the start of the upcoming school year. BoxCamp offers students either a storage box with dimensions 18x18x16 inches for $35 or two boxes of the same size for $65. Students can also store suitcases, microwaves, mattresses, mini fridges and dressers separately for an additional cost, with insurance provided for all stored items.</p>\n<p>Yoder said students will be able to purchase summer storage and flat-rate delivery beginning the last two weeks of school outside residence halls. BoxCamp will allow students to focus on their studies and not have to stress about moving and storage, according to Yoder.</p>\n<p>“During the tenth week and finals week, we will be tabling for new orders, distributing boxes to students living in the residence halls and picking up their boxes to be stored at an off-campus location,” Yoder said. “This will help many students living in the dorms with the move-out process and allow them to focus on their final exams.”</p>\n<p>Yoder said he began working with the Residence Hall Association (RHA) to bring BoxCamp to UCSB after he learned students have few storage options available to them during the summer, because storage units in Santa Barbara are expensive and tend to fill up quickly.</p>\n<p>“We really hope that we can provide a good service to UC Santa Barbara students that they did not really have offered to them before,” Yoder said. “The goal is to help people save some money and not have to take all their stuff home for the summer.”</p>\n<p>BoxCamp representative and third-year economics and accounting major Harrison Goldblatt said he is working on last minute details with RHA, but expects the service to be ready for students during the last two weeks of school.</p>\n<p>“We are not sure exactly where we will be tabling as of now, but students will definitely see us outside the residence halls and on campus during the last two weeks of school,” Goldblatt said. “There, we will be ready to take student orders for their summer storage needs.”</p>\n<p>First-year actuarial science major Kaila Martinez said BoxCamp could be the solution to her storage problem because she is unable to move her belongings into summer housing in Isla Vista immediately at the end of the school year, and it would be inconvenient for her to store them at home.</p>\n<p>“I cannot move my stuff into my new place in I.V. right after finals and I do not want to move it from the dorms down to Oceanside and then back again,” Martinez said. “BoxCamp seems super convenient and might be the right way to avoid moving my things back and forth.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63808\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-26/new-storage-service-to-assist-on-campus-residents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63808\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-26/new-storage-service-to-assist-on-campus-residents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-26/new-storage-service-to-assist-on-campus-residents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-26/new-storage-service-to-assist-on-campus-residents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-26/new-storage-service-to-assist-on-campus-residents/","id":2729,"author":{"id":149,"name":"Max Fernbacher"},"related":[2728,2727,2726],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
