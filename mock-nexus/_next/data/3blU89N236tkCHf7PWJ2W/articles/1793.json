id=\"caption-attachment-94020\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Lea Toubian</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Toubian’s experiences working as a senator and with local campaigns in I.V., in addition to her specific goals if elected, have lent Toubian an advantage over her opponent, Yasamin Salari, who is running with the Isla Vista Party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that is not to say that Salari would not do well in the position — while Toubian has the edge, we believe that both candidates are incredibly qualified to serve as External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). Our campus would be in good hands regardless of who is elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s platform focuses on increasing the I.V. community’s access to its local government and addressing student needs in times of crisis, which includes creating a cohesive emergency response plan that involves the university, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and other organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Toubian aims to increase voter registration among both students and I.V. residents, develop proactive responses to sexual assault in I.V., hold landlords accountable for cliff erosion in I.V. and continue environmental projects such as the I.V. Compost Collective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Nexus does doubt the feasibility of Toubian’s goal to hold landlords accountable in addressing cliff erosion during her term as EVPLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s involvement with Campus Democrats her freshman year allowed her to embed herself in the community and foster personal connections with the I.V. CSD. She also worked as the external director of Associated Students Lobby Corps and was involved in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which secured funding for the I.V. CSD in 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Toubian served as both an on-campus senator and as the secretary of Campus Democrats. After she returned from studying abroad this year, she took a position as the chief of staff for current Internal Vice President Alli Adam. Toubian believes that her time working with the Senate has prepared her for the role of EVPLA, despite not having worked directly with the office before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to learn a lot about the communities that exist at UCSB. I had to learn about how to listen and uplift other people’s voices instead of putting mine ahead of them,” Toubian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of imparting my own biases on someone or a group of people, instead of speaking on behalf of people, [I learned] how to be the representative and actually uplift their voices using the platform that you’re given.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By working as chief of staff for Adam, Toubian said the position, along with her involvement in Campus Democrats, allowed her to stay connected with various groups on and off campus. Pulling from her experiences from Campus Democrats, she also sees voter registration for the upcoming November election as a priority for the office.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also identified various issues around campus that she would like to address using the full power of the EVPLA office, including food insecurity, housing issues and sexual assault in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The benefit of having an office under you is that you could also specifically delegate people to make one issue or a small handful of issues their priority, which I think is a lot more effective than having one person try to tackle and say that they’re going to tackle every single issue,” Toubian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re each able to tackle and be the spearheads for each issue and they can become experts on the topic. There are people who are passionate and most importantly, they’re people who have relevant experiences with that [issue],” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also hopes to expand access to resources by widening normal outreach through Facebook and door-to-door canvassing, particularly for the non-student population in I.V., by providing translation services for non-English speakers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Toubian is receiving our endorsement, the Nexus believes that Salari would also do well in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari served as an on-campus senator on the 69th Senate but </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was removed in Winter Quarter 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for violating the eligibility requirement for the position, which states that on-campus senators must live amongst their constituents. In her interview with the Nexus, Salari cited financial issues as the reason she moved off campus and said that her work in the EVPLA office over the past few months inspired her to run for the position of EVPLA and improve it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari’s platform focuses on expanding on the university’s timely warning system to include any incidents of violence in I.V., not just on campus-associated property. She said she also hopes to work with Students Against Sexual Assault, Take Back the Night, the Title IX office and the Interfraternity Council to establish monthly meetings to assess the campus’ sexual assault climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Toubian is well-versed in the I.V. CSD’s structure and its work, Salari had more tangible experience than Toubian in working directly with the I.V. CSD, as she currently serves as the I.V. CSD coordinator in the EVPLA office under Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this role, she became familiar with the projects of past EVPLAs, such as the police collaborative board, to address safety issues between students and police, a project she hopes to continue. It was also clear that she is knowledgeable about the various entities that the EVPLA and the I.V. CSD work closely with and has working relationships with many of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari also wants to provide a direct bus shuttle between I.V. and Camino Real Marketplace for students to acquire essential groceries, but she was not able to provide a tangible plan or distinguish why her plan was different from the bus lines already in place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also recognized the importance of groups in I.V. besides students, such as the houseless population and families, and wants to work to establish a line of communication through the EVPLA office to learn more about non-student populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout her interview, it was clear that Salari was the candidate who had her ear to the ground in I.V. and on campus and would likely raise more awareness of the EVPLA office among students and student groups. Toubian, whose experience was more political, would benefit from Salari’s student-oriented approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Nexus believes that Toubian’s experience lends her to be a better fit for the position of EVPLA, we acknowledge that both candidates’ work and familiarity with the office and I.V. speak to their qualifications for the job.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot. We heard concerns about the portraits not accurately reflecting what the candidates look like and will actively work to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/lea-toubian-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/lea-toubian-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/lea-toubian-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/lea-toubian-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/lea-toubian-for-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs/","id":1793,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[1792,1791,1790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board","biography":"Not available","articles":[5,1792,1793,1797,1800,1810,2087,2088,2089,2090,2091,2168,2275,2281,2289,2292,2293,2294,2296,3430,3483,3684,7687],"portrait":"Not available"},"related":[{"title":"Thriving Gauchos Travel to Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Swim and Dive","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-15-SwimSeniorDay-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB swim team will look to continue its winning ways against rival Cal Poly when its rivalry is rekindled again this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The men and women’s swim teams are currently on fire.

Low also worked the field and took the victory in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 2:00.99 to give her two first place solo victories on the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mullin and Low are only two swimmers of the many on the talented Gauchos roster that contributed to this fantastic victory. Julia Mikota (23.90) won the 50 yard women freestyle with a time of 23.90 and she also won another event in the 100 yard freestyle with a time of 51.86. Another large contributor to this victory for the Gauchos was their relay teams. At the beginning of the meet, the men’s “A”  relay took first in the 200 yard medley relay with a time of 1:30.26, while the women’s “A” relay also took first in the same event with a time of 1:43.74. Towards the end of the match, the women’s A relay again stole a victory with a time of 3:30.10, and their “B” relay was right behind them with a second place time of 3:33.27.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This victory gives the Gauchos swim teams two excellent records to finish the season, with the men ending with a 5-2 record and the women finishing with a 5-1 record, respectively. This win only added to the amazing regular seasons that the two Gaucho swim teams had, and to demoralize their rivals in the final regular season game truly seems to be the cherry on top.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, this was a big win for the Gauchos and gives them tremendous momentum going into the at MPSF Championship, which will be taking place in February. This regular season was also a large stepping stone for what could be in store in the postseason. The Gaucho swim teams seem to have the recipe for success, and it seems as if they could definitely make a deep run the way they’re tearing up the pool as of late. It should be fun to watch, as the mixture of youth, experience, talent, and dedication is all coming together for the Gauchos at the perfect time of the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rest of the Gaucho swim season starts with the MPSF Championship, which will take place in East Los Angeles, California.

It’s made up of a handful of student caseworkers, who are assigned to students charged with committing disciplinary violations, such as violating a housing contract or academic dishonesty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez’s opponent, current Off-Campus Senator Tyler Ferguson, has done a great deal of important work during his time on the Senate, including putting forward a bill to create two </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-26/a-s-senate-amendment-puts-two-international-student-senator-seats-onto-spring-ballot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international student senator positions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, both through the Nexus’ interviews with the candidates as well as our previous knowledge of their work, we believe Ferguson would have been better suited for another year at the Senate table instead of the position of S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her interview with the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, Perez demonstrated a strong understanding of the issues facing students and a drive to expand the visibility and accessibility of the OSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a senator last year, my second year, and I became very familiar with the institution,” Perez said. “I have two friends who dropped out of UCSB because of financial reasons, or because they weren’t supported as a first-gen student.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve come to know the university and its flaws, and I’ve lived personally the experiences of first-gen students and difficulties through their time at UCSB,” Perez added. “I know that I am capable of improving resources or helping students access the university in better ways.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez served as a senator during the 2018-19 school year and declared candidacy for S.A.G. last spring, but later dropped out of the election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was really drained last year, and I was going through some personal things, and I definitely was not ready to run a campaign for S.A.G., and I was not the person I needed to be in order to deliver the candidate I believed students deserve for the position,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I took a year off, I thought a lot about things, I grew, I healed and I’m back,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last year, Perez has worked as the co-fundraising chair for La Familia de Colores, which she described as a Latinx organization “for queer people of color to be able to have a family, a sense of belonging outside of university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez said that she has been working at various fast food places and businesses since she was 15, gathering experiences that she believes have contributed to her preparation for S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I learned to value a lot of jobs outside of academia, and my experiences outside of it have given me the ability to be able to respond more holistically to students’ issues,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected as the next S.A.G., Perez has a number of platform points that the Nexus believes will move the OSA forward and allow it to better serve students at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez hopes to establish a division of caseworkers specifically dedicated to serving undocumented students, lower the GPA requirement for academic probation, set up online appointments for the OSA and eliminate the $60 </span><a href=\"https://alcohol.sa.ucsb.edu/services/case\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College Alcohol and Substance Education</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (C.A.S.E.) fee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking specifically to her platform point of lowering the GPA requirement for academic probation, Perez noted that a lot of students tend to lose their financial aid if they are on academic probation, adding that it can often be for reasons out of their control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think lowering the GPA [requirement] is going to help students’ well-being and security and retention at UCSB,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoping to build upon the work of former A.S. Senator Zion Solomon, who worked with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to reduce the C.A.S.E. fee from $120 to $60, Perez wants to eliminate the fee altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Perez hopes to partner with pre-existing organizations, such as UCSB 4 COLA and the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support the work they are doing on campus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> particularly through funding from her office, as opposed to creating more branches within the office to do that work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my biggest things is definitely giving back to the community, so sort of uplifting the voices that already exist instead of hijacking organizations, funding movements, offering resources that I know the office has the capacity to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One criticism Perez pointed out about the work of this year’s S.A.G., Andrew Nguyen, and another issue she hopes to tackle if elected, is the lack of visibility of the OSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this current S.A.G. is doing a disservice to students by not being visible enough and [not] providing students the resources or the information,” she said. Perez hopes to utilize social media — TikTok included — to reach newer students and make them aware of the resources at their disposal, should they ever need them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In comparison to her opponent, Ferguson, Perez did not accomplish as much during her senate term. But ultimately, Ferguson seemed like a candidate who was more focused on the internal aspects of A.S., whereas Perez seemed to focus on reaching outward and impacting more of the student body, which is key to serving as S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked why she believed she was the best candidate for the position, Perez recounted a memory from her first year of helping her roommate appeal her academic probation and get her financial aid back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think my experiences inside and outside the university allow me to bring a very unique perspective to this office,” Perez said. “I would hope to be able to provide a safer space for first-gen, low-income students of color to ask for help with the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who has advocated for herself and for those around her for the past few years, Perez is well-suited to advocate for all UCSB students as S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot. We heard concerns about the portraits not accurately reflecting what the candidates look like and will actively work to ensure that this will not happen in the future.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/melissa-perez-for-student-advocate-general/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/melissa-perez-for-student-advocate-general/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/melissa-perez-for-student-advocate-general/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/melissa-perez-for-student-advocate-general/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-16/melissa-perez-for-student-advocate-general/","id":1792,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[1791,1790,1789],"comments":[],"followers":[]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
