Santa Barbara was two strokes off defending champions UC Davis for third overall.</p>\n<p>In the individual leader board, Silvernail shot one over 217 and tied with Cal State Fullerton’s Corey Gard and Eric Sugimoto of Pacific to force a playoff.</p>\n<p>Despite overcoming an eight-stroke deficit to get into a playoff, Silvernail was eliminated after the first round of the playoff, losing the individual medal to Sugimoto, who won the contest after two holes. Silvernail’s final round score was tied for the lowest of any player in the tournament.</p>\n<p>“That was extraordinary for us to watch,” Ley said. “He hadn’t done that before all year, so it was kind of good for him to perform well at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>Coming into Monday, the Gauchos were tied for ninth place and managed to shoot 292 on the day to put them in striking distance going into the third round.</p>\n<p>Top performer for UCSB in the second round was junior Glen Scher, who shot a 2-under par 70, moving him within the top 10 in the individual leader-board. Scher finished the tournament in a three-way tie for eighth place by shooting 5-over par 221, making it the seventh-straight time he has finished in the top 10.</p>\n<p>With a score of 305 in the first day of the competition, the Gauchos at that point were tied with UC Irvine for ninth overall and 13 shots off first place, a deficit that would prove to be too much to overcome by the third day of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“Our hopes of winning the tournament kind of got really squashed because of our terrible opening round,” Ley said.</p>\n<p>Senior Jordan Epstein finished 5-over par and fellow senior Marshall Colby was one shot behind Epstein to conclude the first round. Epstein and Colby ended the tournament in 17th and 41st place, respectively.</p>\n<p>Another notable performance by the Gauchos was delivered by sophomore Amol Mahal who placed 36th overall by shooting 17-over par 233.</p>\n<p>The tournament marks the final competition for the Gauchos this season as they look to build on what they accomplished this year going forward. With only two seniors on the current roster, the team will rely on its core group of returning players for next season.</p>\n<p>“Building on what we did in those last two rounds I think is really going to be one of our goals going into next year,” Ley said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of

id=\"caption-attachment-90039\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3D printer in the CNSI produces protective face shields for medical workers at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital</span>. <em>Courtesy of the CNSI</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while most of the campus remains silent, the 3D printer in the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), located in Elings Hall on campus, hums steadily day through night, producing protective face shields for medical workers at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Magnuson, a third-year mechanical engineering student at UCSB, usually starts his shift in the lab in the afternoon once he’s finished with his classes for the day; he works into the evening, sometimes staying until 9 p.m., or returns to the lab after having dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The routine makes for a long day for Magnuson, but the extra hours in the lab and late nights are worth it, he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After a long day of work, your body starts to hurt and you’re really tired, but it’s reinvigorating to know that these devices are going straight from our hands to the hospital,” Magnuson said. “I think that that’s really what’s keeping me going right now, just the fact that we can have such an immediate impact.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The urgent production of face shields on campus is just one example of how skilled students, researchers and scientists from UCSB are uniting to help the community through the coronavirus pandemic. When the campus was still open, another group of researchers in the Materials Department made batches of hand sanitizer for community use. And presently, professors across campus are developing a coronavirus test that would be simpler and faster than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coronavirus test.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Face Shield Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in the CNSI lab, Magnuson and David Bothman, the organizer behind the face shield production, work opposite shifts to keep the 3D printer running to produce as many parts as possible for the face shields. The shields, which are meant to go over medical goggles and face masks, consist of a transparent shield, headband and strap, all based off a </span><a href=\"https://budmen.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design created by a 3D printer manufacturer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By early April, the team had created and delivered 40 face shields to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and had 40 more ready for delivery. But the hospital’s needs are “tremendous,” said Bothman, who normally lectures on mechanical engineering at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The hospital needs 10,000 shields of the style we’re making. We can make, you know, 20 or 30 a day … but it’s clear that a lot of other people and people with a lot more manufacturing capability are going to need to be involved,” Bothman said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other groups on campus have joined in the production of face shields, including Roger Green, manager at the chemistry and biochemistry machine shop. He and Andy Weinberg, the machine shop superintendent, obtained enough materials to make 3,000 face shields. The two had finished cutting the clear plastic covers for 200 shields with a 3D printer in early April and with the help of a couple more people in the production process, Green said his team would likely soon be able to produce about 200 clear plastic covers a day.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hand Sanitizer Production</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over in the Materials Department, Assistant Professor Angela Pitenis had been worrying about the coronavirus pandemic early on. Before </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB canceled in-person classes on March 10</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she cut the normal lesson plans she had for her graduate class, Colloids and Interfaces,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and instead presented on the colloidal formation and stability properties of hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking notice of the rising anxiety over coronavirus among the students in her class, she decided to dedicate a lecture to demonstrate how to make basic hand sanitizer. Then she had the idea to produce hand sanitizer for the entire campus community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This whole project really began as a truly class exercise to demonstrate basic principles, but it also links back to the work that we do every day in materials science,” Pitenis said. “I think it was a very good lesson for the students to be able to see how lessons in the classroom can translate to practical engineering solutions, especially in response to COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining forces with colleagues Rachel Segalman, Raphaële Clément, Craig Hawker, Christopher Bates and Michael Chabinyc, all professors in the UCSB Materials Department, the group pooled together their reagents to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in their labs for community usage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically, any kinds of solutions we could find, we would put them together,” Pitenis recalled. She said she isn’t sure how much hand sanitizer they made altogether, but she estimates “gallons.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Segalman’s lab members, chemical engineering doctoral student Audra Destefano, came up with the creative idea to design a label and call their hand sanitizer “Universal Corona Sanitizing Balm.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The name], which was very clever … really encapsulated the efforts we were trying to do here, which was to support our community,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scientists distributed their hand sanitizer around campus, including among their shared facilities, the Materials Research Lab and the CNSI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the hand sanitizer went directly to those shared facilities to support students and staff at the time who were still having to use those shared facilities to maintain their critical research, and also to support our staff, who might not have time in between experiments to wash their hands,” Pitenis described.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Pitenis emphasized handwashing over hand sanitizer, noting that it is more effective and a practice that the CDC </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/pdf/hand-sanitizer-factsheet.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recommends</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since campus operations, including most research labs, have shut down, Pitenis and her colleagues have ceased their hand sanitizer production, for now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’ve made enough to support the needs of our community,” she remarked, adding that if there was a need for more, her team could always produce additional hand sanitizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we’re all trying to help out as much as we can; I think this is a total team effort right now. And I’m just incredibly amazed and I’m just humbled by the efforts of my colleagues,” Pitenis said.</span></p>\n<p><b>Coronavirus Test Development </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across campus, four professors from the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) are working tirelessly to develop a coronavirus test that would be faster and easier to use and would not “rely on the common reagents that the rest of the world is scrambling to get,” said Max Wilson, an assistant professor in the MCDB department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilson, Carolina Arias, Diego Acosta-Alvear and Kenneth Kosik all know each other from teaching and working together in the MCDB department, but as the coronavirus pandemic tore through U.S. communities and the lack of available testing became more obvious, the group stepped up to help fill the gap in resources and information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw that there was a massive need for testing and we decided that we would use our labs and our skills as molecular biologists to help,” Wilson said. “We were all scientists studying other things before this. We dedicated funds from [other projects] to develop this because we saw how important it was.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the CDC’s test as a benchmark for accuracy, the team created a test for coronavirus that uses an enzyme similar to the family of enzymes used in a CRISPR test, a method that </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/coronavirus-test-crispr-mammoth-biosciences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scientists around the nation have already begun to tap into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that targets repetitive DNA sequences. This test uses the enzyme to recognize the presence of the coronavirus viral genome and indicates a positive or negative result on a lateral flow dipstick, a testing device similar to those used for pregnancy tests, according to Wilson.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the beginning of April, the group was tinkering with adjustments to the test to make it cheaper and easier to use. The professors also began looking into the process of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which is currently being fast tracked for coronavirus tests but could still likely take months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s gonna be a long way, unfortunately,” Arias said. “We are still far. I don’t want to give anybody false expectations or false hope </span>that we’re going to have something that can be deployed tomorrow. It is a process [that requires] approval.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to developing a new coronavirus test, the professors </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also donated enough critical reagents, an essential component in the current CDC coronavirus test, for 600 tests to the Cottage Health laboratory, the Santa Barbara Independent </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/04/02/ucsb-molecular-biologists-to-the-rescue/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arias’ role in the project has been to coordinate approval processes and navigate protocols for the research to take place. Besides that, she also teaches general animal virology to a class of 185 students remotely –– a task faced by UCSB’s entire teaching faculty and one they had a mere </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two weeks to prepare for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> –– and serves on UCSB’s COVID-19 Response Working Group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And we have families so we don’t stop. If it’s not one thing, it’s another one,” Arias said. “I cannot even tell you at what time [the day] begins or what time it ends.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the researchers are propelled by an extreme sense of urgency to find solutions and provide information to the public, a collective effort they “hope is going to be significant” in the community’s fight against coronavirus, Arias said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, the team is discussing the possibility of using their coronavirus test in a research project that would focus on the prevalence of coronavirus in asymptomatic patients. The project could reveal information about how the virus spreads, but until the test is FDA approved, patients involved in the project would not be able to know the results of the testing, Wilson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While much remains uncertain about the timeline of their projects and the future in general, Wilson, Arias, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acosta-Alvear and Kosik are steadfast in their mission to help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people might feel helpless and I just want to reassure them that many of the best scientists I know are working as hard as they possibly can to come up with solutions that will ease the pain on this pandemic,” Wilson said. “There are things coming.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2108.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sofia-mejias123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sofía Mejías-Pascoe</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sofía Mejías-Pascoe is the deputy news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
