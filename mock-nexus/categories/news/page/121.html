violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately 150 students participated in the two-hour long event, walking in heels or other feminine clothing to promote safety and respect for women.

My high school took part in walks every semester and seeing it take place in college is an absolutely amazing sight,” Duong said. “We, as fraternity men, want to work with the community to benefit everybody and having the thought of ‘Oh, X fraternity is prone to sexual violence against women’ leads to adversity in our mission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sigma Pi Herald and third-year biology and economics double major Austen Mauch, the UCSB Greek community stands against sexual violence and is actively trying to reverse the negative stigma surrounding fraternities and rape culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sadly, I do know that statistically 1 in 6 women are a victim of sexual assault, every two minutes someone in America is raped and 1 in 4 college-age women will be sexually assaulted during their time in school,” Mauch said. “Sexual assault is more than just a ‘Greek’ issue. It is a human issue. Even one case of sexual assault is one too many … We wanted to bring this issue to the forefront of everyone’s mind so together, everywhere, we can change the violent culture we unfortunately see today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMauch said UCSB is not the only university where sexual violence occurs and that altering people’s perspectives can be a first step toward changing the campus environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many people do not understand the struggle that others have to endure,” Mauch said.  “By taking the opportunity to walk in someone else’s shoes maybe we can begin to understand what others are subjected to … Until everyone, every brother and sister, son and daughter, mother and father, friend and neighbor, can walk alone with no fear of sexual violence we haven’t done enough. Until everyone can go anywhere at any time without fear of sexual violence we have not done enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways. – Third-year biology major Kevin Duong\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuong said the event was successful if even one person changed his or her opinion on fraternities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One thing to note is that sometimes events like these don’t feel like it was ‘successful’ but in my eyes, even if one person was swayed to change their opinion then it was successful,” Duong said. “If even only one person we saw walking down Pardall changed how they saw fraternities here at UCSB, we did a fantastic job and should continue to push our solidarity for the safety and comfort of women in similar ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMauch said while it was difficult walking in high heels, this was his favorite part of the event because it allowed him to better relate to those who choose to wear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was definitely an eye-opening experience,” Mauch said. “It was incredibly difficult and tiring and made me truly appreciate what women and men go through when choosing to wear heels. I believe the event went very well, and through our constant chanting on the walk of ‘listen, believe, support’ definitely drew most people’s attention and hopefully inspired some inquiry into sexual violence awareness and prevention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Duong, the students participating in the walk received positive support from bystanders as they marched through I.V. toward Embarcadero Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My favorite part was actually when we started entering I.V. past the Pardall Tunnel and our entire group started chanting, ‘listen, believe, support’ while doing our walk,” Duong said. “It showed that we not only were men who could change our footwear for a mile, but that we were willing to, as a collective, voice our concerns for the women in I.V.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMauch said by attending the event, participants made a promise not to be passive bystanders when it comes to preventing sexual violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were pledging to stop sexual violence, and that any and every time they see anything questionable anywhere, they will not stand idle,” Mauch said. “We need the culture to change. We need everyone to speak out, stand up and not let the violence continue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Kappa Sigma Grand Master Guillermo “Memo” Llamas, the event went through multiple stages of planning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Preparing the event required filling out forms, reserving the plaza, making posters and signs, and spreading the word to invite as many individuals as possible to the event,” Llamas said. “Leading up to the event there were several educational workshops geared towards improving sexual violence awareness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMauch said his fraternity chose to host Walk a Mile in Her Shoes to fulfill the community service requirement which all Sigma Pi chapters must complete because he thought it could make a significant impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The high heels were supposed to symbolize the struggles of women and anyone who identifies as a woman,” Mauch said. “Having a group not accustomed to the struggles of women would have an opportunity to walk a mile from their perspective.

their annual rally and march on Thursday night at Anisq’Oyo’ Park to address sexual assault in Isla Vista and to protest the climate of fear and violence women face near campus areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately 40 participants attended the event to support the campaign against sexual violence. The event included poetry readings, music, art, games, t-shirt making and art projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEditors from \u003cem\u003eFeministing.com\u003c/em\u003e Lori Adelman and Jos Truitt spoke at the event about what constitutes feminism.  Adelman said feminism might cause strife between genders as power dynamics change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we’re talking about feminist goals, we’re not necessarily talking about a zero-sum game,” Adelman said. “There are some things that we are asking, telling and demanding that men and people who have been operating under the privilege of patriarchy give up. And it’s not something they can do without maybe some direct personal loss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Adelman, feminism is not a friendly request, but a demand for what is owed to an individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t us asking for you to do us a favor and be nice and from the bottom of your heart or to be kind and give us these small feminist wins,” Adelman said. “We’re asking and demanding power. It’s not always going to be an amicable relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt sunset, attendees marched through I.V. with signs labeled “Slut shame is victim blame” and “My body is mine.” After the march, attendees regrouped at Anisq’Oyo’ Park for a “survivor circle” to share personal thoughts and stories about sexual violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake Back the Night Co-chair and third-year feminist studies and English double major and Kelty Kauffman said females are constantly on edge when they are out in the streets after dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s scary going out at night,” Kauffman said. “When you’re someone who’s not a straight white dude, going out at night means doing a checklist in your mind of things that could go wrong, figuring out how to keep yourself safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Kauffman, this year’s event saw a new, wider range of emotions compared to last year’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This year’s event had a lot of heart,” Kauffman said. “There were a lot of tears and there was a lot of healing, but there was also a lot of laughter, which is not something that I’ve experienced in these spaces before, and that felt really, really good. We were okay to laugh. It was allowed. People were allowed to express themselves however they needed to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKauffman said the organization aims to empower women in order to gain the same privileges as men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The phrase ‘take back the night’ means taking back our autonomy, our ability to leave the house, our ability to do things like a regular person would, and by regular I mean straight white dudes,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said after she was sexually assaulted last year, survivor resources at UCSB advised her against taking the case to court against her wishes. According to Melgoza, Judicial Affairs claimed the case would not make it to court, and if it did, she would not win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately I only got to enjoy my college experience one quarter here at UCSB,” Melgoza said. “Survivors all have different ways of healing and coping … There’s not a single label or stereotype but unfortunately, Judicial Affairs wanted me to fit a mold. I had to persist and literally argue with them through phone calls, emails and appointments. I had to make sure they were doing their job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird-year math major Maya Trifunovic said the event was informative and ensured the topic of rape remained relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We still live in a rape culture,” Trifunovic said. “There’s a lot of conversations that I think especially people our age need to be having about the society we want to build as we go out into it. I think it’s a good space and really educated people with a lot of resources and ideas about how to fix that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger said there is more to sexual violence than the victim and the perpetrator, and “sexism encourages rape culture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s so much that plays into sexual assault. I think people tend to look at it as a person to person thing, like it’s an individual perpetrator’s problem,” Ballinger said. “But really, it’s a result of people giving their tacit approval.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Ballinger, events such as Take Back the Night remind community members and survivors that they are not alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s really important that survivors know that other people care,” Ballinger said, “and that there’s awareness about it. Being here is educational. It helps me learn more about what’s really going on and things under the surface.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBallinger said sexual assault is more common than most students realize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think everybody knows someone who is a survivor,” Ballinger said. “You could be sitting in lecture and the person next to you could be a survivor and you wouldn’t know. People just don’t know that they know survivors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth-year feminist studies and global studies double major Presly Mellor said “taking back the night” means women should not have to live in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see it very literally where we take back the night,” Mellor said, “where we, as women, can walk freely without feeling threatened, without feeling the need to look over our shoulder multiple times on a walk back home at night, I don’t have to worry about being too drunk or having to walk down a dark street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Mellor, she hopes the organization will continue its fight to end sexual violence and assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For me, it’s really empowering to see what younger students are organizing and leading because I’m on my way out, but I still want this work to be done,” Mellor said. “It’s really nice to hear that first-, second- and third-years are going to be dedicated to this cause the rest of their time at UCSB.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellor said though participation rates have not changed since she attended in 2013, the diversity of participants has greatly increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s been a change in the people coming which I think is good, because it shows that more people are interested and different kinds of people, all different majors, different years,” Mellor said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate resolution to divest from companies committing human rights violations in Israel/Palestine and I.V. self-governance. Nine of the 13 candidates running attended the forums, all of which were associated with Open People’s Party (OPP). The 13 candidates are competing for 12 available seats, each of which represent roughly 1,000 undergraduates who reside off-campus. Each candidate had one minute to answer each question during the 50-minute forum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn regard to student fee allocations, first-year undeclared student Natalie Jordan said she would like to implement a quarterly review to help students understand how A.S. uses fee revenues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been talking to students almost all week,” Jordan said. “Something a lot of you don’t know is that you pay almost $200 every quarter into student fees that go into Associated Students to pay for things like take-out at Ortega, the bike paths and things like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year political science and sociology double major Austin Hechler also said he would work to make sure fee allocations are more transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to work with the Student Fees Advisory Committee to make sure that our fees are a lot more transparent,” Hechler said. “About 34 percent of our student fees go to 400 NCAA athletes, and I feel like we can reallocate those fees to services that are more available to the general population.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst-year history major Sasha Bates said he is concerned students do not understand how their fees are allocated nor how A.S. functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like to have more talks between the students and the government, so you actually know where you money is going,” Bates said. “When I’m walking around in Isla Vista and talking to people they don’t actually know what the Senate does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst-year political science and Asian American studies double major Akshaya Natarajan also said she wants students to better understand A.S.’s role on-campus and expressed her desire to lobby for better public higher education funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My goals for next year is to increase involvement and awareness on our campus so students like you and I can get involved in the fight against the defunding of our education on the state level and to fight against tuition hikes,” Natarajan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding the A.S. Senate resolution to divest from companies committing human rights violations in Israel/Palestine, Hechler said the movement is an issue “out of the students’ hands” and “on the global level.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It really doesn’t bring our campus together,” Hechler said. “Although it is a large issue, it is important to realize that a lot of the consequences from divesting or investing are not things that the university cannot really take a stand against.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBates said A.S. should not have to decide how the University of California invests its funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think it’s the role of universities to take stances on geopolitical issues,” Bates said. “I don’t think it’s the role of A.S. to decide what other people should do with their money or what political beliefs their money should represent, so I don’t think the university should support divestment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan said she would be willing to express a position on the matter after further understanding the divestment issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would be happy to listen to both sides,” Jordan said. “With further knowledge, in the future I would be able to make an educated decision on what we should do if this were to come up again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Natarajan however, she supports the campus movement for UC to divest from companies committing human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I support this resolution and I would hope to see that the divestment discussion on the UCSB campus be much more inclusive than divisive,” Natarajan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year history of public policy and political science double major Jerel Constantino said the issue of divestment is beyond A.S.’s agenda, because a previous bill calling for an end to human rights abuses has already addressed the issue at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a dialogue that our population has to have, but I don’t think a bill for or against divestment is the way to make that dialogue,” Constantino said. “We’ve already had a bill to stop funding for human rights abuses, which answered the question, so I don’t know why it keeps on coming up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn regard to sexual assault, Bates said A.S.’s first step should be to educate students about sexual violence on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sexual violence is a huge deal, and our rates of sexual violence are a lot higher than a lot of other campuses across the nation,” Bates said. “The best way to stop all of our issues of sexual violence is through awareness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHechler, who sits on the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) as Vice President of Communications, said he would bring in IFC to assist in his efforts to prevent sexual violence in I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe the most important issue with sexual assault and sexual violence is that not a lot of people are aware of it,” Hechler said. “I would like to begin with the Greek community by really making sure that everyone in the Greek community is aware of this issue, because if I feel like the Greek community is such a strong and compassionate group that will rally around anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said she is a survivor of a sexual assault and would work to create change in the university process for handling sexual assault cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am a survivor of sexual assault on this campus,” Melgoza said. “I have been working effortlessly to make changes and awareness over and over and over again not only with students, because I am a part of Take Back the Night, but also as well regarding my own case. It is not easy exposing myself to everyone, and I am making sure that policy changes are made.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan said she would support OPP External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) candidate Paola Dela Cruz’s idea of creating a “safe space” at the Pardall Center to improve the Community Service Officer (CSO) program on campus and in I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something I feel extremely passionate about is the Pardall Safe Space for women at night,” Jordan said. “Also, I’d really like to expand the CSO program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird-year communications major Erin Barnett also said he was in support of Dela Cruz’ ideas for space spaces for students in I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to work with her to make sure that, if you’re uncomfortable or if you’re drunk and you don’t have a place to go home at night, you can go there,” Barnett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBates said A.S. should also address sexual violence by taking into account students’ frustrations with local police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the most important things we can do to stop sexual violence in Isla Vista is reach out to the police,” Bates said. “I’d like to improve police relations and continue the forums we’ve been having with the pizza with police officers, and maybe even improve it to something on campus with more people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year political science major Isabelle Ninh also wants to work to improve relations with local police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I look forward to continuing that and making sure that when the police are out there, we as students do not feel threatened and they understand that we as students have a right to defend ourselves and that if they are going to police us it is for a very legitimate reason,” Ninh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding Greek life, Jordan said the university should continue to not tolerate any misconduct from affiliated chapters within Greek life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I personally think that hazing and things like that shouldn’t be tolerated on this campus,” Jordan said. “I think that UCSB has already take a pretty large stance on that, and this tradition should be continued.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe candidates also discussed I.V. housing issues and whether or not A.S. should purchase property in I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHechler said A.S. should not buy property in I.V., but rather support making I.V. a Community Service District (CSD) through State Assembly member Das Williams’ I.V.\u003cbr\u003e\nself-governance bill AB 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Property in Isla Vista is very expensive — probably some of the most expensive you can find in California — and that would not be a good way to spend our money,” Hechler said. “I think the way to go about this issue is to support AB 3 all the way to the county legislature.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBates also said the purchase of I.V. property would be an inefficient use of A.S. funds and also supported I.V. self-governance bill AB 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The most important thing for almost all of the issues with housing in Isla Vista is self-governance,” Bates said. “The best way to get a hold of Isla Vista and actually make meaningful change in Isla Vista is by making Isla Vista into something more than just unincorporated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Barnet, A.S. should support efforts to establish I.V. as a CSD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We absolutely need to support the AB 3 bill,” Barnett said. “People in Isla Vista need to be in control of where they live.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Barnet also said he would also support A.S. buying property in I.V. in order to address current student housing issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve done a lot with property in Isla Vista, and I think the Pardall Center is a good example of that,” Barnett said. “I think it would be a good idea to be able to house students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan said she also fully supports A.S. buying property in I.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The acquisition of property in Isla Vista is actually extremely important for Associated Students,” Jordan said. “This would stop rent fluctuation by buying the property up, which would help low-income students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstantino said he supported A.S. buying property in I.V., as long as they consider how it might affect residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel like the university should take a bigger role in Isla Vista,” Constantino said. “My part as an off-campus senator will be to make sure to pressure the university in that the decisions they make and the property they buy or lease is made consciously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelgoza said she would address I.V. housing issues through informational workshops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a lot of housing issues, such as sometimes students don’t know how to sign a lease or are not informed,” Melgoza said. “I really want to make sure to set up workshops on that regarding housing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version

against Students for Justice in Palestine’s resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine by a tiebreaker secret ballot of 13-12-1 after a lengthy eight-hour meeting last night in the Old Little Theater and Givertz 1004.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth-year economics and accounting major and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau took the votes on the resolution by secret ballot and gave the tie-breaking “no” vote following the Senate’s initial 12-12 split and one abstention over whether or not to pass the resolution. The failure of the resolution to pass marks the third consecutive year the A.S. Senate has denied passage of a divestment resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC campuses whose undergraduate student governments have not passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in Nov. 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year sociology major and SJP member Anumita Kaur co-authored the resolution which calls for the UC Regents, UCSB, Associated Students and the UCSB Foundation to withdraw investments from several companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine. The resolution specifically names Motorola, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as companies infringing on citizenship rights of those in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Garza, second-year Ph.D candidate in the department of sociology and SJP member, said the organization is disappointed with the outcome of the Senate’s vote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are frustrated that our Associated Students will go another year being complicit with these human rights violations perpetrated by these companies, but we are also as motivated as ever because … in the way the debate has changed the past few years, we feel that it’s only a matter of time … a global movement like this can’t be stopped by the vote of a handful of A.S. senators,” Garza said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year CCS physics major and CCS collegiate senator Liam Stanton, who called for a roll call vote prior to the motion to vote on the resolution, said the secret vote forced Lau to take responsibility for the consequences of the vote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What makes me upset about the result of tonight’s vote wasn’t which side won or lost,” Stanton said. “It was the fact that we didn’t have the courage as public representatives to put our votes out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanton said the tie vote and resulting tiebreaker decided by Lau created an unfortunate situation in which Lau will “almost singularly” receive blame for the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think either side behaved particularly well,” Stanton said. “We instead forced the president of our Senate to put out her vote. She was the only public vote and so all of us got to hide, except for those who announced their vote. She had to take the heat almost singularly for everyone else from the community who feels marginalized now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year communication and political science double major and off-campus senator Hiro Bower said she called for a secret ballot because she believed it was necessary given the strongly opposing sides on the divestment movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called for a secret ballot. That’s why I defended having a secret ballot … people have a lot of very strong opinions about this,” Bower said. “How do you make a decision when you’re considering the entire student body, when the entire student body has two very different sides?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Bower, situations like divestment increase pressure on A.S. Senators to carry out decisions as representatives of the totality of the student body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So in that case a lot of pressure is put on your shoulders and not everybody is comfortable with facing everybody there because you cannot make a decision without feeling horrible about it,” Bower said. “Yes, that’s like something we took on when we decided to run, we all knew that this was coming … but still, at the end of the day, we’re students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff-campus Senator Michelle Moreh, one of the main senators in opposition to the resolution, said the Israeli West Bank barrier separating Israel and Palestine is necessary because of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one is arguing that all Palestinians are terrorists, but how should Israel deal with terrorist organizations that are hiding themselves amongst civilians and using them as a cover to murder Israelis?” Moreh said. “In my opinion, one-sided security shouldn’t come at the expense of others.

Sabra also said the decline of the Ottoman Empire and rise of Arab nationalism in the late 19th century also facilitated interest in an Arab state in what by 1922 was the British-controlled “Mandate of Palestine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The conflicts between the Zionist movement and the Palestinian nationalist movement really goes back to the late 19th century, early 20th century,” Sabra said. “A key moment in this was the Balfour Declaration of 1917. Britain was at war with the Ottoman Empire and ultimately captured Palestine … and in response to request from British Jews who were supporters of the Zionist movement, the British issued a statement saying there should be a Jewish national home in Palestine, they didn’t say state.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Balfour Declaration specifically stated the government of the United Kingdom did not wish to see inequality perpetuated in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object,” the declaration reads. “It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sabra, tension grew between Arab communities and Jewish communities in the post-World War I international situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This started a situation that grew worse after the end of the war,” Sabra said. “A lot of immigration by Jews from Europe to Palestine was being pushed by flight from … persecution. At the same time, the Palestinian Arabs also were saying the possibility that they would have some kind of Arab state … this led increasingly to intercommunal tension.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabra also said the establishment of the state of Israel led to further tension among Arabs and Jews in the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think the Palestinians had a problem with Jews as such being citizens in their state; Jews were citizens in other Arab states in much larger numbers in those days,” Sabra said. “That changed after the foundation of the state of Israel in the Arab-Israeli wars. … It wasn’t the presence of Jews that was the issue, it was the attempt to shift the demographic mix and to establish specifically a Jewish state that the Arabs felt they would have no place in this and would be second-class citizens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabra said the 1948 Arab-Israeli War involved mass emigration of 90 percent, or roughly 700,000 people according to the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, of the Arab population in Palestine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is debate about how this actually took place, but it’s pretty clear that in some places they were actually driven out, other places they fled the fighting,” Sabra said. “The Israelis made the clear decision not to allow them to ever come back. These are the people who became the Palestinian refugees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, according to Sabra, the Israelis granted Jews all over the world the right to come to Israel, called the right of return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can see this as a matter of providing Jews a last refuge, but it was also effectively a matter of demographic policy, because without the Jewish population elsewhere, they would not be able to build a Jewish state,” Sabra said. “If they allowed the Arab citizens … to return home, they also would not get a Jewish state. So Israel was founded basically on ethnic cleansing. There’s really not much doubt about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.S. resolution articulated support for a right of return for Palestinian refugees to the modern state of Israel, which Tagger said is anti-Semitic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they were all to return to the Jewish state it would extinguish the Jewish state as we know it and Jews would become the minority in their homeland,” Tagger said. “The right of return is as something that is part of the BDS movement [and] is in the larger framework of anti-Semitism by telling Jews they can’t be where they have historically been as an indigenous people for 3,000 years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern Middle East history professor Sherene Seikaly said the Israel-Palestine conflict is primarily centered on territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The conflict in Israel-Palestine is a conflict over land; it isn’t a 2,000 year old conflict, it isn’t some struggle from time immemorial,” Seikaly said. “For centuries, people of multiple faiths in the Arab World and under Ottoman and before that under Islam lived and co-existed … until the 12th century, 90 percent of the world’s Jewish population lived under Arab and Muslim rule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeikaly also said it is only with the rise of Zionism and Arab nationalism that the categories of “Arab and Jew” become mutually exclusive, a product of “contemporary nationalism.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think nationalism promises everybody equality,” Seikaly said. “But the way that it promises everybody equality is that we all have to be the same in a sense … There is a way historically throughout many examples that the nation state has necessitated exclusionary and violent practices.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeikaly said such practices occurring alongside the formation of nation-states are difficult at embracing difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it inevitable that nationalism is violent or … is there a way that one could have a nation state that wouldn’t be violent? I don’t know,” Seikaly said. “I think a process that is built on the foundation that there is some kind of natural ‘link’ between all of a certain group of people … I feel like that kind of project is going to be very difficult to be embracing difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabra said the founding of Israel was based in part off the denial of certain rights, including equal access to education and housing; to others as a matter of policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When they talk about founding a Jewish state, it was not to found a state necessarily that was Jewish religion-predominated, it was to found a state which was by and for Jews which offered Jews a different set of rights than offered others,” Sabra said. “It’s a policy. Israel is a Jewish state and therefore Jews have different rights than other people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sabra, adherence to such policy is not unified among all constituencies in Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s always been this tension in Israel between more liberal tendencies that wanna say, ‘Well, okay we’re not gonna go back and reverse the conflict but at least the people who are still here should be equal citizens,’” Sabra said. “But increasingly that’s not the case anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sabra, the Likud Party, the current ruling party of the Israeli legislature, the Knesset, wish to pass a law defining Israel constitutionally as a Jewish state to prevent the Israeli Supreme Court from finding non-Jewish citizens are entitled to legal equality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The direction of politics these days is away from any kind of equality … it’s an ethnocracy,” he said. “It would be like if we said, ‘Well, America is a white state and black people can live here; they shouldn’t expect to go to the same schools, they shouldn’t expect to live in the same neighborhoods, they shouldn’t expect equality in the courts. We don’t owe that to them.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62527\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62527\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/","id":2791,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2790,2789,2788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up April 10-12","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230\u0026ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339\u0026ssl=1","description":"Isla Vista law enforcement dealt with multiple reports from residents including an attempted suicide, a resistant probationer and a missing persons report last week.","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"single-post-content\"\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003eIsla Vista law enforcement dealt with multiple reports from residents including an attempted suicide, a resistant probationer and a missing persons report last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Thursday, day-shift deputies handled a residential burglary on the 6500 block of Trigo Road. After speaking with the victim, deputies collected evidence and established probable cause to arrest a female suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursday night, a female walked into the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) office and filed a report for an anonymous message she had read on the anonymous social network Yik Yak. The unidentified sender stated the individual had gone into the woods and tried to hang himself, but was unsuccessful when the branch of the tree he was using snapped. The sender continued to post that he was depressed because his parents had been killed the day before and that he had no desire to live. Deputies received an additional call for service stating that another reporting party had read the same message on Yik Yak and was concerned for the sender’s safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers tracked the location of the posting and organized a search stretching from the bluffs west of Camino Majorca out toward Campus Point, but failed to locate the sender. As the search was occurring, the sender deleted the original message and posted another stating his roommate had found him and taken him home. Law enforcement responded and searched the area once more, but was unable to locate any associated persons. A report was written and the search for the sender was canceled after all resources were utilized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Friday night, deputies went to a residence on the 6700 block of Abrego Road to conduct a probation search on a probationer. The probationer remained passive-aggressive throughout the encounter and delayed the investigation by not allowing deputies to search his electronic media. He was arrested and booked for resisting arrest and for violating his probation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDispatch received a call on Saturday night that immediately hung up when answered. Upon callback, the anonymous reporting party alerted dispatch in Spanish that the probationer from the previous night was in a fight with his father. Deputies returned to the residence and found the probationer restrained by his father. Further investigation revealed the probationer punched his father during an argument, and the son was booked into City of Santa Barbara Jail after his father signed a citizen’s arrest for battery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso on Saturday night, a victim reported from the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive said she woke to the sound of someone in her bedroom. Though she was unable to see the subject in the dark, the victim believed it was one of her roommates. The victim reported hearing her wallet being unzipped and the subject leaving the room, and later discovered $160 had been taken from her. She called her roommates and learned none of them were home, and the front door had been unlocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficers received a missing person’s report Saturday night of a female who was last seen walking westbound on the 6600 block of Pasado Road. The female was said to be highly intoxicated and ignored her friends’ attempts to take care of her. Officials conducted a search of the area and the female’s cell phone was remotely located, but the location was several hours old and the phone was powered off. It was later reported that the female returned home, and she was removed from the Missing and Unidentified Persons System.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Sunday, a victim reported her laptop was stolen from her home on the 6500 block of Segovia Road.

Yang, one of which would be appointed from the full County Board of Supervisors and two members elected at large from within the boundaries of the Isla Vista proper, and three elected from districts in IV, two of which would comprise IVRPD jurisdiction and one representing the university property surrounding IV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is important that people who are residents of the IVRPD, which are the primary boundaries of the IVCSD, are the majority on the IVCSD Board,” Ebenstein said. “What I would suggest would be then four members elected from the boundaries of the IVPRD of which two would have four-year terms on staggered basis — so at each election there would only be one person be elected to a four-year term.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond-year political science major Louis Mariano said if a student is elected to the board, they should have a system in which the student would serve for six months as an intern to gain “institutional knowledge and actually use it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_62399\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62399\" data-attachment-id=\"62399\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-15/office-of-das-williams-community-discuss-i-v-self-governance/ab-3-das-williams-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?fit=600%2C401\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429037372\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"170\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB-3 Das Williams-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?fit=600%2C401\u0026amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62399 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?w=600\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AB-3-Das-Williams-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167\u0026amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-62399\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHari Patel/Daily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst-year political science and Asian American studies major Akshaya Natarajan said having a student unofficially appointed to the board to gain experience would be good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still being temporary enough where students are empowered to run for one of these positions, but at the same time it still gives them a bit more experience before they have voting power,” Natarajan said. “So perhaps exploring a designate status where they could be elected and serve for six months rather than an internship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHutchins presented the second proposal of the meeting and said the Assemblyman’s office could hold a CSD conference during which community leaders and businesses could voice their opinion on current CSD ideas. Hutchins said participants could then distribute their plans for comment to I.V. agencies, organizations and interest groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What you might want to do is stop the endless discussion,” Hutchins said, “and start thinking on more global or situational terms. For me, what that meant was it would be easier to be the task of this group to essentially create two bookend proposals for CSD … and ask the university chancellor and university trustees who are perhaps inconveniently your best friends right now in terms of getting anything through because they have already taken positions on the CSD.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC.A.P.S.

Bringing businesses into Isla Vista — I think that will bring down prices and that will bring up quality, and will help us become a city, and finally end this self-governance issue once and for all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollegiate Senator Candidate Forum\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_62366\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62366\" data-attachment-id=\"62366\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-14/a-s-forum-brings-candidates-to-the-hub/collegiate-senator-panel_vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428924056\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"220\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Collegiate Senator Panel_Vivian Bui-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397\u0026amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62366\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=600\u0026amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165\u0026amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Collegiate-Senator-Panel_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330\u0026amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-62366\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eSix OPP members running for collegiate senator seats. \u003cem\u003eVivian Bui/Daily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix candidates running for positions as collegiate senators representing the College of Letters and Science (L\u0026amp;S), the College of Creative Studies (CCS) and the College of Engineering spoke at a candidate’s forum in the Hub yesterday in preparation for the upcoming Associated Students elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour candidates will ultimately be elected to represent L\u0026amp;S, one for CCS and one for Engineering as prescribed by the A.S.
