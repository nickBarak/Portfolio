Election Results\" href=\"http://www.as.ucsb.edu/elections/full-results_spring2014.html\"\u003eAssociated Students Elections Results\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e as the Open People’s Party took nearly every position for the second year in a row, with just one Democratic Process Party candidate and one independent candidate getting voted in. All quarterly lock-in fee reaffirmations were approved and new fees for Queer Commission/LGBTQ  students and a composting program were passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuarterly student fees for a sobering center in Goleta, renovations and expansion to the University Center, the campus’s annual ‘senior book’ and a literary magazine called \u003ci\u003eThe Catalyst\u003c/i\u003e all did not pass. Meanwhile, O.P.P. swept all the executive positions, with third-year sociology and psychology double major Ali Guthy voted in as A.S. President, third-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau as Internal Vice President, third-year sociology and Asian-American studies major Beatrice Contreras as External Vice President of Local Affairs and third-year political science and film and media studies major Melvin Singh as External Vice President of Statewide Affairs. Bailey Loverin was voted in as Student Advocate General; running for the position requires the candidate to be independent of campus political parties. OPP won almost every position on A.S. Senate, except two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, OPP won every position except one uncontested spot. However, A.S. Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus said he still found the far-reaching victory unexpected. Theus, a third-year sociology major and member of the OPP, said there were concerns that voter turnout numbers may be low because of the party’s sweep last year and in years past, such as in 2009, 2011 and 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought people were lost in this mentality that OPP sweeps, so they didn’t have to vote,” Theus said. “Kind of like this mentality in America, where people don’t vote because they don’t think their vote counts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking several factors into account, such as campaigning style and which student demographics and campus groups each party reaches, Theus said OPP has secured loyal voting blocs such as Jewish student groups and greek life. In light of ongoing divestment talks, including one just Wednesday night, Jewish students and their campus organizations have helped the party get more votes, according to Theus. In fact, three of the four OPP candidates for executive positions were endorsed by American Students for Israel and Gauchos for Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Theus, the larger Jewish student population may be supportive of the party due to the fact that many senators affiliated with OPP have voted down the A.S. resolution to divest from Israeli companies associated with human rights violations in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would say Jewish students have been loyal because of OPP’s votes in Senate for divestment over the past two years,” Theus said. “OPP was founded by a Jewish student, but I was here freshman year election, and the Jewish students were not that involved in our election,” Theus said. “I think the divestment thing definitely has a sort of pull on votes in a certain way. It’s sad; it’s kind of used as a sort of strategy towards the elections.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the elections results, a constitutional amendment to add two more senators had also passed. Lau, who was the only executive candidate to run unopposed, said she was eager to start her new plans as A.S. IVP right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just excited to really work with the senators, orient them into their positions, and really let them know what they’re going to be doing so that they can start planning during the summer,” Lau said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Singh, the win left him “speechless.” Like Lau, Singh said he is going to start up his projects and other work as soon as summer comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once summer hits, my plans will start setting in motion and everything will be more clear from this point on,” Singh said. “I’ll be having more substantial steps towards the goals that I wanted to present and start making the office more student-friendly and give them a stronger voice on the statewide and UC levels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDP Party Presidential Candidate Navkiran Kaur, third-year Black studies and sociology major, said she plans to remain involved in student life and campus organizations. Given party resources and how the electoral process plays out, she said the big win comes as a red flag in determining how democratic A.S. Elections really are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we really need to question our elections process. We really need to wonder why the same people are monopolizing all the power in Associated Students because that is not okay,” Kaur said. “The Associated Students is not actually associated with the students. This is not actually a true representation of the students — having a sweep is never a good thing … it’s always better to have a mix of students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCarissa Quiambao and Aditya Tadanki also contributed to this article.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\"\u003eThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"gallery-55015-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/results5_Sarah-Kouklis_4-24-14.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"55022\",\"title\":\"results5_Sarah-Kouklis_4-24-14\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Front row from left to right: Melvin Singh, Beatrice Contreras, Ali Guthy and Angela Lau.\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/alexg_ASElections2014_4.24-8.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"55021\",\"title\":\"alexg_ASElections2014_4.24 (8)\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"DP Party Executive Candidates wait for elections results with apprehension.\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/alexg_ASElections2014_4.24-12.jpg?fit=5184%2C3456\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"55019\",\"title\":\"alexg_ASElections2014_4.24 (12)\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"DP Party Executive Candidates Daniela Bayon, Kashira Ayers and Navkiran Kaur react to the OPP elections sweep.\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/AS+Elections_Apr24_EricSwenson-3201355431-O.jpg?fit=520%2C300\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"55018\",\"title\":\"AS+Elections_Apr24_EricSwenson-3201355431-O\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Melvin Singh reacts to his election to the position of External Vice President of Student Affairs.\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/AS+Elections_Apr24_EricSwenson-3201356341-O.jpg?fit=520%2C300\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"55016\",\"title\":\"AS+Elections_Apr24_EricSwenson-3201356341-O\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker hugs Student Advocate General-elect Bailey Loverin after the announcement of her victory.\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/AS+Elections_Apr24_EricSwenson-3201357138-O.jpg?fit=520%2C300\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"55017\",\"title\":\"AS+Elections_Apr24_EricSwenson-3201357138-O\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker and OPP Off-Campus Senator Andre Theus hold up A.S.

Elections. ","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"single-post-content\"\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003eThe annual A.S. Elections process can be a superficial, emotionally charged spectacle, but the fact remains that A.S. has millions of dollars of student money at its disposal and those elected will have at least some say in how it is spent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite our student government’s preoccupation with making itself “transparent” and “accessible,” figuring out how each candidate plans to spend student money — and whether or not their plans are worthwhile or even plausible — can be a daunting task. Promises of increased efficiency, endless open forums and overly ambitious projects abound, while creative proposals with real chances of success are harder to come by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eDaily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e editorial staff sat down with each of the executive office candidates in an effort to cut through this noise and determine which candidates have the personal qualifications necessary to bring about durable changes. We searched for the candidates most likely to benefit the student body as a whole — specifically, the ones most likely to inject fresh, new ideas that hold more substance than constantly regurgitated rhetoric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reviewing these interviews and researching proposed fee initiatives, the staff voted on which candidates are best for the job and whether or not new fees are a reasonable use of tuition. As reflected in our endorsements, some of these decisions were clear cut and unanimous, while others took lengthy debate to come to a consensus and are therefore more qualified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the well-researched and much-debated opinions of our staff, these endorsements are meant to serve as a guide for voters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCandidate Endorsements\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.S.

Unlike her opponent, Kaur holds previous experience working in the Office of the President in addition to experience in other areas of the university. A third-year Black studies and sociology double major, Kaur first became involved with the Office of the President her freshman year when working with the A.S. Leadership Education Program. Since then, she has served as an A.S. senator, took part in Orientation Programs and groups within the Office of Student Life, and during her second year, she earned A.S. Project of the Year for work completed for the Student Commission on Racial Equality, or S.C.O.R.E.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat sets Kaur apart from her opponent is her talent for grassroots organizing: She co-founded the South Asian Students Association and has organized quarterly events that have brought together up to 50 different campus groups. Whether or not Kaur has held an elected position, she has been working at the campus level — as well as at state and national levels through lobbying efforts — to serve students. In light of recent incidents of violent sexual assault in I.V., she promises to organize a safe space center for partygoers, and she plans to set up I.V. swap meets where students can trade and sell goods like textbooks and furniture. In this regard, Kaur looks to project plans that are ambitious yet feasible, while opponent Ali Guthy looks to projects that are long-term ideas that have been sitting in the idea tanks of A.S. for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her own set of qualifications, Guthy is heavily involved with A.S., has some lobbying experience and helped launch the “Swipes for the Homeless” program this year as an A.S. senator as well as authored the restructuring of A.S. However, spearheading A.S. projects or writing A.S. legislation is something Kaur has also done, and Guthy holds no experience working within the Office of the President. Her promise of a 24-hour café is something that has been talked about for years and has never come to fruition, and she wants to expand community center space in Isla Vista after A.S. just spent thousands to secure space for the Pardall Center. But the expensive and pretty unnecessary pet projects don’t end there — she also supports the proposed SURF fee that will costs students $20 a quarter and over $60 a quarter beginning in 2018 to pay for building renovations that the university administration could, and should, be paying for. It also promises increased space for campus groups that already have meeting places or could possibly use one of the spaces that already exist in the UCen, where the proposed renovations would take place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a solid background in university life and experience that extends beyond UCSB, such as her multiple years of lobbying in Sacramento and Washington, Kaur holds the experience and concrete ideas to run the A.S. of UCSB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInternal Vice President: Abstain\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eNexus\u003c/em\u003e does not endorse a candidate for the Office of Internal Vice President based on the lack of a fair race between two candidates for the position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe DP Party announced last week that they would not sponsor a candidate for the position, effectively guaranteeing victory for Angela Lau of OPP. Lau’s qualification for the office comes from her experience as an Off-Campus Senator and second pro-tempore last year, as well as her current position as the Academic Affairs Board Chair. A third-year economics and accounting major, Lau also served on Committee on Committees and Finance Board. Some of her larger goals include organizing orientation workshops throughout the year to encourage student involvement, securing more student jobs through an A.S. sponsored computer repair shop and requiring groups who earn A.S. lock-in fees to submit spending reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Lau possesses experience and plans, she did not give a clear explanation of how she would implement certain goals, such as one project that the A.S. IVP candidate has been talking about for years: videotaping weekly Senate meetings. Lau said there are some “legal obstacles” to videotaping meetings, but then clarified that the only such obstacle would be having senators sign waivers that give permission to be videotaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the most part, Lau’s plans are ambitious but honorable. She has promised not to hold closed senate meetings and limit the persistently increasing A.S. staff salaries, but she also implied that she may at some point use secret ballots during public senate meetings and did not have a clear plan for videotaping meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, Lau appears qualified for the positions, but some of her plans appear vague and not well-organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExternal Vice President, Local Affairs: Daniela Bayon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eNexus\u003c/em\u003e cautiously endorses Daniela Bayon for the position of External Vice President of Local Affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big issue facing the EVPLA candidates this year was controlling Deltopia, yet neither candidate had a concrete plan on how to host the event safely next year. Despite this, the \u003cem\u003eNexus\u003c/em\u003e chose to endorse Bayon because of her original, practical and feasible set of ideas for next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen in office, Bayon hopes to partner with the SBCC student government to share costs associated with events such as Halloween and Deltopia, while also launching a website called ratemyIVlandlord.org, which would hold landlords accountable for things like broken lease agreements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer opponent, Beatrice Contreras, seemed ever ready to have students spend more money by proposing that Isla Vista become a community service district, with an increased sales tax to fund projects.* Given the high cost of living in Isla Vista, Contreras’s idea of an increased sales tax is the last thing Isla Vista’s residents need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile neither candidate was particularly impressive, Bayon’s ideas seemed more creative and original than Contreras’s. The financial burden of Halloween and Deltopia should not fall upon UCSB, and Bayon seemed to have a starting point to change that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExternal Vice President, Statewide Affairs: Melvin Singh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003cem\u003e Nexus\u003c/em\u003e endorses Melvin Singh for the office of Associated Student External Vice President for Statewide Affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office is responsible for lobbying UC administration and state government on behalf of students and keeping students up-to-date on statewide issues that might affect them. A thorough understanding of the processes and politics behind decision-making at the state level is a key qualification for the post, and Singh seems more knowledgeable in this area than his opponent, Kashira Ayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingh, who currently works in the EVPSA office as a campus organizing director, plans to increase the office’s publicity efforts, hold frequent policy-focused workshops and maintain UCSB’s reputation for high voter registration. He has also laid out specific lobbying goals for his office that include tuition exemptions for non-state veterans, more student representation on the board of Regents and a re-evaluation of the California Master Plan of Higher Education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAyers, who previously served as chief of staff in the office of the Student Advocate General, played a key role in pushing the Black Student Union’s demands on the UCSB administration. While she does have extensive experience lobbying, Ayers lacks concrete ideas about how to use the office of the EVPSA to advocate for students on a statewide level and address issues currently facing the UC, which she seemed to have a limited knowledge of. Additionally, she does not seem prepared to lobby for students on a system-wide level and has little experience working with the UC Regents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, both candidates had similar ideas on how to use the office of EVPSA to better inform students on campus about current issues facing the UC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStudent Advocate General: Bailey Loverin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eNexus\u003c/em\u003e endorses Bailey Loverin for the position of Associated Students Student Advocate General.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Loverin’s opponent, Amir Khazaieli, has strong ideas for reorganizing the office from the top down to streamline efficiency, Loverin has realistic and concrete plans for the future of the office that make her a better choice for the position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth candidates praise the work of current Student Advocate General Kristian Whittaker to reorganize the office and wish to build on the foundation he has set this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoverin’s plan for the office includes dividing the office among two chiefs of staff who will handle programming and caseworkers separately, ensuring each case has only one caseworker and working to produce maximum efficiency for each branch of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoverin’s outreach plans for the office are equally impressive and include efforts to have advocates and herself personally meet with students in the residence halls and dining commons on a weekly basis to assess their concerns, a consideration not voiced by her opponent. Loverin also plans to increase the accountability of law enforcement via police review mechanisms and has demonstrated greater willingness to consider the needs of students by planning to create a fund to assist students in paying for necessary documents needed in a hearing such as police reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, while Khazaieli has two years of considerable experience as a collegiate senator and seems well versed in the functioning of the office, Loverin’s familiarity with its needs, as Whittaker’s chief of staff, provide her with a more grounded and solid perspective that we believe will allow her to lead the office more effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFee Initiatives\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAssociated Students Fee Initiatives\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSURF: NO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eNexus\u003c/em\u003e does not endorse the Student Union Revitalization Fund (SURF) Initiative, a fee that will charge students $20.51 per quarter until 2018 and then increase to $64.41 until 2048 and continue onward as a reduced fee until the project debt is retired. While the overwhelming laundry list of organizations the fee claims to assist may seem beneficial just by its sheer ability to make the average reader fall asleep before reading the fee’s entire description, students should not be fooled by its extravagant wording and hefty promises. Setting aside the fact that $20.51 is a colossal amount of money to be asking from students (let alone a whopping $64.41 after 2018), the initiative itself is entirely misleading.

The SURF initiative prioritizes expansion at the expense of taking attention away from things students actually need, such as an expansion and new fee for Counseling and Psychological Services, who has seen a 23 percent increase in students look for counseling help. Plans to have features such as “Senate Chambers” to overlook the lagoon (when Senate only meets once a week) is just plain excessive, especially for a fee that had little to no student input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQueer Comm: YES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eNexus\u003c/em\u003e endorses the proposed A.S. lock-in fee of $2.12 per undergraduate per quarter to provide funding for the Associated Students Queer Commission.

We can begin working towards that,” Mirza said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis story is a \u003cem\u003eDaily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e online exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/students-divided-over-uc-divestment-issue/","id":3019,"author":{"id":170,"name":"Lannhu Khuat"},"related":[3018,3017,3016],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

After Lau, OPP’s Guthy and Democratic Process Party’s Kaur spent an hour discussing topics such as campus safety, university affordability, their plans for aiding underrepresented communities at UCSB and their past experience with A.S. and other organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLau’s plans centered on increasing the visibility and transparency of the Associated Students Senate, keeping senators on track with their individual projects and creating new job opportunities for students across various majors in hopes of providing work experience for students facing a competitive job market after graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regards to creating more job opportunities for students, Lau said she would work to build more A.S. entities similar to the A.S. Bike shop but tailored to different majors. As an example, Lau said her first priority would be founding an A.S. Computer Repair shop, where students with technical skills hoping to work with computers in the future could both gain experience and earn money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In this economy … students who go to a four-year university are not able to get a job afterwards,” Lau said. “In the end, experience gets jobs. …What I want to do is really create more student services to create these jobs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked what Associated Students means to her, Lau said she sees the association as a means of helping students complete projects and make changes they care about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Associate Students is really empowering students,” Lau said. “It’s something that we use as a tool to complete things that mean something to us. …We are the future, we are students and Associated Students really gives us that avenue to feel like we can make a change on not only this campus … but also the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Lau’s forum, Kaur and Guthy took to the stage in order to answer the audience’s questions in their vie for the presidential office. Kaur has previously worked in the A.S. Office of the President, as an A.S. Senator and as co-chair of Student Commission on Racial Equality, and she currently sits on the board of the United States Student Association. Guthy is currently A.S. Letters and Science collegiate Senator and previously worked as Santa Cruz Hall President and on Community Affairs Board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth candidates named university affordability as their top priority, as they both said there is currently a lack of investment in higher education of the state. Both said they would work to organize lobbying efforts with state legislatures. Guthy added that she, like Lau, would work to create more job opportunities for students as a way of alleviating some of the cost, while Kaur said she would facilitate quarterly swap meets where students would be able to trade books and furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs during the other forums that happened this past week, Kaur and Guthy were asked about Deltopia and their thoughts on what happened and who was responsible, in addition to how to move forward and prevent similar occurrences. Guthy said although she could not attend due to a student lobby conference in Sacramento, she felt that a lack of communication between students and law enforcement was largely responsible for the riots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That event shook me,” Guthy said. “I believe that the circumstances that led to the events of Deltopia primarily were miscommunications between students and law enforcement … One potential solution to this is the creation of a police advisory board.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur agreed that miscommunication greatly contributed to the proceedings, and added that there should have been a town hall beforehand to better prepare the community. Kaur also said she was wary of encouraging an increase in police presence in Isla Vista as a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe that we should really even have more police. I think that police can make certain communities feel unsafe,” Kaur said. “I wouldn’t blame the police either for the events that happened, but I think we need more communication … I do believe that we should be policing the police, in fact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne area in which the candidates did not agree involved UCSB’s membership status on the United States Student Association. According to Guthy, UCSB currently pays $10,000 per year to be a part of USSA, in addition to the $150,000 a year to be a part of University of California Student Association. A bill has recently been presented to the A.S. Senate that would withdraw from USSA on account of finances. Guthy said she felt strongly that USSA is an important organization and network for students across the nation, but she said UCSB would still be involved in USSA through its UCSA membership and did not think it was worth paying the additional $10,000 to USSA each year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Membership in UCSA gives us membership in USSA … so withdrawing from USSA does not mean we are not members; it means we are no longer direct members,” Guthy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur, who sits on the Board of Directors at USSA and who has attended every USSA conference since her second year, said she believes the association has been the “most empowering organization” of her life. According to Kaur, while UCSB would still technically be involved through UCSA, it would no longer be able to send a delegation to the conference each year, and therefore she opposed withdrawing membership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“USSA is one of the most important organizations in this nation. Student power can move mountains,” Kaur said. “As a board member of USSA, I actually have to say that even though we would be members through UCSA, there would no longer be a UCSB delegation, and that is a shame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked why each candidate chose their respective parties, Guthy said she chose OPP due to its track record of creating tangible change, citing the grants they pushed for and received for increased lighting in I.V., the expansion of campus wifi and a letter-writing campaign to legislatures lobbying to stop cuts to the state budget that drew over 11,000 letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was particularly drawn to this party because we have a history of creating tangible change on this campus that directly benefits students. … As president, I want to continue that legacy,” Guthy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur also praised her party’s tangible accomplishments, notably the A.S. food bank, and the textbook marketplace and added that she chose DP because she saw a strong DP presence throughout the year across multiple important campus organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are the party you will see year-round, regardless of elections. … We are the students who have been there, [who] have been at the front lines of change since day one of their experience here,” Kaur said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last question posed to candidates before their closing statements prompted them to describe how they had worked to aid underrepresented communities at UCSB. Guthy said she acknowledged that she comes from a position of privilege, but that she has worked for underrepresented communities through Swipes for the Houseless and would continue to educate herself and reach out to those communities as president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t identify with a lot of communities who feel that they are underrepresented on this campus — I acknowledge this,” Guthy said. “I really want to work by collaborating with [and] working for a future that, we all as Gauchos … can all work towards. … As president I will continue my work and outreach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaur listed the several organizations she has been involved with since coming to UCSB that work to serve minority students, and said she would continue doing everything within her power to fight for the underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, coming in, was struggling with my identity as an Indian woman,” Kaur said. “It really opened my eyes to how institutions in this country really oppress certain people and give privilege to others. … I continue to learn and educate myself. … I believe it begins with education.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth candidates closed the forum by asserting their passion and drive for the UCSB community and Associated Students. Voting begins Monday at 8 a.m. on GOLD, and the results will be announced the following Thursday at 7 p.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoto by Kenneth Song / Daily Nexus\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54906\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54906\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-18/a-s-presidential-candidates-debate-in-final-forum/","id":3020,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3019,3018,3017],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The funds collected from the fee would go towards operations, facility rental and staffing, according to the fee initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to A.S. Legal Resource Center attorney Robin Unander, who has been working on bringing a sobering center to the community for many years and called it the center’s “brain child,” the center would serve to cut down on the number of arrests for drunk-in-public citations, keeping students’ records free of misdemeanors and reducing the cost of an arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Unander also said a fine would still have to be associated with the sobering center to act as a deterrent to repeat offenders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the partying in I.V. goes on where people live, there needs to be something in place that tells students ‘You don’t want to do that again if you can avoid it,’” Unander said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Unander, the fines collected for a night spent in the sobering center would help to pay for its operation and the money collected through the fee initiative would only have to be used as a startup cost allowing the center to eventually pay for itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssociated Students Internal Vice President Kyley Scarlet said she has been working on the ballot fee initiative since being a senator last year and that students brought to the sobering center would be handled primarily through the school and that a record of their stay will remain private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When it goes on your BARC it will not say ‘drunk-in-public,’ it will say something like ‘administrative fee,’” Scarlet said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlet said that any fee assessed by the Alcohol \u0026amp; Drug Program would be listed on BARC as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.S.

Instead, students would be held in an alternate space primarily occupied by students. Moore said the sheriff’s department would also benefit from the center by not having to drive students downtown, saving valuable time and allowing deputies to spend more time patrolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore said he thought the benefit to students, as the primary users of the center, would justify the cost of the initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s like insurance,” Moore said. “You’re looking at paying for it right now and you’re like ‘Man, I don’t know if I want to pay for that.’ But the first time your car gets nicked or the first time you get sick, that insurance policy turns into something amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis story is a \u003cem\u003eDaily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e online exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified A.S.

It would have funded the construction of a roundabout at the northwest corner of the Student Affairs Administration Services Building next to the tunnel between the Recreation Center and Campbell Hall. The proposed roundabout would replace what the Bike Committee calls the “triangle of death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Emily Littleworth, chair of the A.S. Bike Committee, the decision, made after the initiative was reviewed by the UCOP, who maintained that the University should fund this project since it is a “safety issue on campus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We knew that we had to take that advantage of the opportunity to have the University fund this,” Littleworth said in an email. “It makes a lot of sense. Students shouldn’t have to pay to make the campus a safe place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUCOP’s recommendation to withhold the fee initiative is partially attributed to potential repercussions that may come from acknowledging the zone as a “safety issue,” according to Littleworth. If acknowledged by the administration, accidents at the intersection could become a legal liability for the campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If there was a major accident at an intersection documented as ‘unsafe’ that the university hadn’t taken care of, there could be an expensive lawsuit,” Littleworth said in an email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the 2012-13 school year, the A.S. Bike Committee began the project after receiving complaints from students about the intersection and hearing about bicycle and pedestrian accidents occurring in that area. Since the conception of the idea, the Bike Committee has spent approximately $76,000 on manager fees, design fees and concept sketches for the proposed roundabout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, during its campaigning period, the initiative did not garner enough signatures to make it onto the Spring ballot. But in March, A.S. Senators voted to forgo this and allow the initiative on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff-Campus Senator Jimmy Villarreal, who voted for the initiative to be put on the ballot, said he wanted to give students the freedom to choose whether or not they wanted to improve the bike path intersection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think the students should be able to decide what they’re paying for,” Villarreal said. “I wanted to give them the option to build it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to A.S. Bike Committee Vice Chair Mac Kennedy, every year the UC Police Department receives about 30 to 40 bike accident reports per year while Student Health assists hundreds of accident victims a year. In light of these statistics, Kennedy said University administration should be responsible for student safety on the bike paths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the process of retracting has only just begun, Kennedy said he and the Bike Committee feel confident that the University will choose to fund the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After communication with UCOP, they said it doesn’t make sense to fund it, so we’re pursuing university funding,” Kennedy said. “We’re confident that they’re going to understand this is a strong public threat to our safety on campus. We’ve already pretty much decided, and it doesn’t cost the university much money at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy said he anticipates that the final decision will be made by the end of this week. Currently, the Bike Committee is in collaboration with Vice Chancellor Michael Young regarding how to approach the project. Members of the Committee plan to meet with Marc Fisher, Senior Associate Vice Chancellor and Administrative Services and Campus Architect, next week to continue the discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmber Munoz, a third-year comparative literature major and Vice Chair of the Isla Vista Community Relations Committee, said the unsafe intersection may damage UCSB’s reputation as a bike-friendly campus. She also said the area needs renovation regardless of whether or not the initiative is retracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve seen so many near or close accidents that have happened at that intersection, especially because there are so many students,” Munoz said. “Biking is a really intimidating factor for people who are coming to visit UCSB and the area should be seen as safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittleworth said she is eager to begin negotiations with University administration regarding the funding of the project. She said she hopes to see the proposed roundabout completed before fall quarter of next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I look forward to the negotiations and hope to see this project completed during the summer,” Littleworth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRilla Peng contributed to this article.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the\u003cem\u003e Daily Nexus.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54895\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54895\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/a-s-bikes-to-retract-lock-in-fee-initiative/","id":3034,"author":{"id":189,"name":"Loree Lewis"},"related":[3033,3032,3031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Catalyst Requests Lock-in for Print Costs","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The students behind The Catalyst, a new student-run literary arts magazine, have requested a lock-in fee in the upcoming Associated Students election in an effort to ensure continued quarterly publica...","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"single-post-content\"\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003eThe students behind The Catalyst, a new student-run literary arts magazine, have requested a lock-in fee in the upcoming Associated Students election in an effort to ensure continued quarterly publications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA revival of the Catalyst Literary Journal, which ran from 1992 to 2007, the magazine is a student publication of the UCSB English Department that allows students across different disciplines to collaborate and showcase their creative art and writing. The proposed lock-in fee will charge undergraduates $1.08 a quarter, beginning in the fall quarter of the 2014 academic year and will go towards publication and distribution costs of The Catalyst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the $1.08 fee, $0.75 will go towards The Catalyst with the rest directed towards A.S. and administrative services as return-to-aid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inaugural Winter 2014 issue of The Catalyst featured creative prose, poetry and academic writing juxtaposed with hand-drawn art and photos.

Each candidate was allowed 30 seconds to a minute for each question asked, giving them time to argue both their party’s positions and their own personal platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe panel lasted for a duration of one hour and began with the discussion of the more pressing and pertinent issues on campus, with safety being first discussed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy Fernandez, a first-year sociology and feminist studies major running for On-Campus Senator with OPP, said she sees the need for increased safety on campus through increased implementation of lighting structures. She suggested installing light structures near the tunnel by Student Health and the Rec Cen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe candidates also discussed physical and mental safety of the students against issues such as homophobia and intolerant attitudes of prejudice or discrimination. According to Unique Vance, a first-year environmental science major running for On-Campus senator with DPP, students should not feel worried about the security of their own homes at UCSB and should receive consistent services that ensure their safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of people feel unsafe in their own dorms and their own homes, and that should not be an issue,” Vance said. “I really want to include more safe places for students in their own homes so that they can feel safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso at the debate, candidates discussed UCSB students’ well-being as well as higher availability of exercise classes at the Recreation Center and workshops on health. In addition, they touched on the topic of food quality in the dining commons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmani Oakley, a first-year political science major running for On-Campus Senator with OPP, said the dining commons should accommodate more students by serving special nutritional needs, such as gluten-free diets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the things I would do to improve health and wellness would be to provide more nutritional facts,” Oakley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension arose within the debate when the topic of A.S.’s effectiveness and its potential improvements was brought up to candidates. Steven Kwok, a first-year economics and accounting major running for On-Campus Senator with DPP, said the organization is not quite as “associated” as he believes it should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To me, Associated Students … should be an organization associated with its students. But right now, it’s not doing its job,” Kwok said. “So I think how Associated Students can improve is to stop making promises it can’t keep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the same vein, Alonso Martinez, a first-year mathematics major running with DPP, said he feels A.S. needs to increase efforts of transparency so students know more about their organization and their works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I definitely want to make sure that the Associated Students is more transparent — that people know what’s going on,” Martinez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the debate ended with short closing statements from each candidate. Third-year film \u0026amp; media studies and black studies double major December Brown, for example, used the time to sum up her goals and restate her purpose in running for University-Owned Housing Senator with OPP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“UCSB is our home, and I would love to be a voice for all of our people,” Brown said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the \u003cem\u003eDaily Nexus.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54891\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54891\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/prospective-a-s-senators-debate-in-the-hub/","id":3030,"author":{"id":187,"name":"Daniella Chung"},"related":[3029,3028,3027],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Queer Commission Fees To Appear on Upcoming A.S.

Members of the Elections Committee moderated the debates, fielding questions from audience members to the candidates and touching on topics related to a candidate’s core values and party ties, as well as their opinions of existing projects and practices within A.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEVPLA Debate\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the position of EVPLA, which deals with community affairs in Isla Vista and Goleta, OPP’s Beatrice Contreras debated with DP’s Daniela Bayon. Contreras has worked as an Off-Campus Senator for the past year, while Bayon has been heavily involved in Isla Vista Community Relations Committee and has worked to develop a landlord-rating website that is expected to go online later this quarter. The two candidates professed similar agendas, proclaiming their determination to focus on sexual assault and hate crime prevention, housing fairness, communication with law enforcement and community centers in Isla Vista, among other issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about increasing safety in Isla Vista, Contreras said she would set up a board of students that would keep close contact with police and foot patrol in order to keep students both informed and included in law enforcement decision-making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There needs to be a lot more communication with Isla Vista Foot Patrol, and one thing I have as a specific platform is to create a law enforcement advisory board so that we can all sit down and talk about what our community policing priorities are,” Contreras said. “We can have students, non-students, community members and police officers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContreras also advocated implementing a rape crisis center in Isla Vista. Bayon, in her answer to the same question, proposed creating a legal complaint coordinator, in addition to a center in I.V. for those who felt harassed or assaulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the biggest issues with safety in Isla Vista is issues dealing with women and men — all folks — on sexual violence,” Bayon said. “This space will be a space for all students and survivors of sexual assault to go and have a safe space on Friday nights and on Saturday nights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn regards to Deltopia, which drew in roughly 10,000 more people than last year based on County officials’ estimates, Bayon said that while she agreed with increased efforts for open communication with law enforcement, she also said some communities do not feel safe working with police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayon and Contreras differed slightly on their opinions of the proposed fee increase for renovations to the University Center, called the Student Union Revitalization Fund. While Contreras said she fully supported the fee, Bayon said she believed more work needed to be done on the project before the fee was passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Contreras, budget constraints on the university mean that students have no choice but to fund the project themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I definitely do agree with the UCen lock-in fee,” Contreras said. “Although it’s a shame and we shouldn’t have to raise student fees, it’s important to be faced with the reality that there are budget cuts going on … we really need to work with what we have … we need to provide those services for ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Bayon, before the SURF fee passes, the people in charge of the project should work with a larger number of student groups to devise a more universally beneficial plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve heard a lot of different mixed feelings from a lot of community members and a lot of students and a lot of BCCs on campus,” Bayon said. “I think that this UCen lock-in fee needs more work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked to explain the ways in which they had worked to support students of color and queer students on campus, Bayon said she has consistently been an advocate of inclusive language, expanding safe-zone training to police and residence halls. She also mentioned her earning of a Gender and Diversity requirement, rather than a European Traditions requirement, while Contreras said her efforts include advocating for a Gender and Sexuality general education requirement. Both candidates cited their experiences as women of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the EVPLA debate, Bayon stressed the Rate My Landlord project as one specific goal she hopes to accomplish by both getting the site running and setting up a system for it to continue in future years. On the other hand, Contreras talked about developing a community center in Isla Vista that would serve both students and non-students alike, although A.S. just recently launched a similar project called the Pardall Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEVPSA Debate \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second debate last night pitted OPP’s Melvin Singh against DP’s Kashira “Kash” Ayers for A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs, which deals with statewide issues in higher education, such as UC budget cuts, and student lobbying and organizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions focused on the appointment of Janet Napolitano, the United States Student Association, the California Master Plan for Education and its revision project, plans for working with other UC campuses, collaborations with legislators, the California budget for education and party alignment. The candidates come from different backgrounds, with Singh having worked with Student Lobby and the Office of the EVPSA, and Ayers holding experience in organizing and lobbying with the Black Student Union.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about UC President Janet Napolitano, both candidates said they had a problem with her appointment, although they differed in their approaches to moving forward with her. Ayers said she would focus on organizing student talks with Napolitano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to acknowledge that I do have a problem with the appointment of Janet Napolitano,” Ayers said. “As students at this university, we should have a say in who our UC president should be. … As EVPSA, I will work with her in hosting forums that are open to all students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingh said he would continue ongoing negotiations with Napolitano, saying he felt optimistic based on her reception to past demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t approve of Janet Napolitano’s past … however, she is in the position right now where she is a public figure,” Singh said. “Compared to past UC presidents, she is more of a politician and more indebted to our needs. … She’s been very receptive since her appointment. I’ve seen her engage with students, and I hope to continue that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about the first issues the candidates will tackle if elected, Ayers said she would focus on voter registration and organizing forums for students who are unable to vote, while Singh said he would focus on securing stable costs tuition and preventing another tuition hike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about the state of the United States Student Association, Ayers and Singh both said it can be a powerful tool for student lobbying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As students, we have power in numbers,” Ayers said. “USSA is effective because it builds a strong coalition of students that can network inside of these spaces and outside of it …We need to get more students there, especially first- and second-year students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the California Master Plan for Education, Singh said he supported efforts to revise the Master Plan based on a changing context for California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The problem with it now is that it’s not clearly defined for all students,” Singh said. “I’m totally supportive of pushing the Master Plan across California … I’m very optimistic about it, and it’s something I will back up as EVPSA.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModerators asked candidates which aspects of the budget each candidate would focus on advocating for, given current budget constraints. Ayers said she would focus on increasing financial aid, increasing diversity on campus and allocating more money towards resources for students such as psychological services. Singh said he would focus on affordability and accessibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth candidates were asked why they chose to run with their respective parties. Ayers, although maintaining that she does not believe in party lines, named several factors that drew her to the Democratic Process Party. In particular, she mentioned the fact that DP has an open, democratic primary for electing candidates while OPP does an interview process to select individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parties can be abrasive sometimes, but I chose the Democratic Process Party for the simple fact that they have an open primary,” Ayers said. “It’s issue-oriented and action-based, and it’s a progressive party,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingh said he chose to run with the Open People’s Party mainly based on its means of achieving policy goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OPP happens to have the methods and the actions that I agree with, when it comes to enacting the opinions that I have,” Singh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSAG Debate\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third and final debate of the evening occurred between Bailey Loverin and Amir Khazaieli, independent candidates for Student Advocate General.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoverin has worked for the past year as the Chief of Staff in the current Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), while Khazaieli has sat on Senate for the past two years as the collegiate senator for the College of Engineering. Debate questions touched on how each candidate would balance transparency and confidentiality, restructure the office, resist conflict with personal interest, combat sexism and racism and plan for student outreach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of its structure, the OSA currently has the SAG, a Chief of Staff and four divisional departments — each with two caseworkers. The departments at present are housing, academic, public interest and student conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf elected, Loverin said she will replace one of the caseworkers in each department with a program director responsible for outreach efforts. She also said she will add a program director at the level of Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, Khazaieli said he plans to first hire entry-level fellows who are not initially affiliated with a specific department but do casework. Khazaieli then said he will add a position in charge of transparency at the level of Chief of Staff and alter the divisions to be on-campus housing, off-campus housing, campus policy and non-university legal issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding issues of sexism and racism, Loverin said she will increase the role of the public interest division, which serves to help and support student groups and is a department added in the office just this past year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to push them to work with S.C.O.R.E. and other campus organizations that deal with these issues,” Loverin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Khazaieli, more work needs to be done in regards to discrimination and efforts should be completed in collaboration with A.S. groups. He said he will do everything in his power to defend the student bill of rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter what your affiliation or how you identify yourself, you should not be discriminated against,” Khazaieli said. “A lot more can be done with cooperation with student groups in A.S.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen each candidate was asked why he or she was the best person for the job, Loverin cited her experience as Chief of Staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have the hands-on experience in the office,” Loverin said. “I’ve been dedicating my entire year to this … I also have contacts with administrators… But what’s really important here is that I care about this position — I love this position and I want to serve students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, Khazaieli said he understands the impact that the OSA has on students since he himself required its services when he was a first-year student.

A discussion ensued to determine whether or not to correct the mistake — despite SJP members’ understanding that they would still receive the money — with the final decision culminating in taking back the funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore discussing the SJP fund issues, however, Executive Officers presented to the Senate the work their offices have been doing in light of the “civil unrest” that occurred Saturday evening of Deltopia, with senators later discussing potential strategies to prevent such occurrences in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.S. President Jonathan Abboud devoted most of his speaking time to the matter of Deltopia and its repercussions. Abboud said the events were distressing, with bottles and rocks thrown at police personnel and then the police responding with tear gas and rubber bullets. However, he said A.S. reacted quickly to the incidents and that their response was well received by the general public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The cool thing is that we were the ones sending out the message and not the university, so Associated Students was ahead of the game,” Abboud said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud also said most officials seemed open to working with students. In a meeting he attended with External Vice President of Local Affairs Alex Moore and all of the Senior Officers of the university, he said officials looked to find a solution with the students rather than seeking to enact harsher restrictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We discussed just kind of what happened that weekend, and the tone of the conversation was surprisingly pro-student, and not, ‘Let’s just crack down,’” Abboud said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud said there would be a committee set up to assess the cameras that appeared in Isla Vista just before Deltopia, and he confirmed to Senators that the cameras were paid for by the university and were intended for temporary use only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudent Advocate General Kristian Whittaker also spoke about Deltopia during his report to the Senate. According to Whittaker, the most pressing issue for his office since Saturday has been that some students have been told by police that they could be evicted from their homes or expelled from UCSB based on their participation in the civil unrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhittaker said students can only be expelled if they engage in an act that “indicates a breach of the student code of conduct.” Eviction, he said, depends on specific lease agreements and would be left to the discretion of the landlord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore’s report discussed the reasoning behind requesting an investigation from the Civil Grand Jury on Saturday night’s events. Moore said he and other officers felt it was important to request a third-party investigation since no such circumstances of riots, tear gas and other events came up during previous Deltopias. Moore said he hopes the investigation can shed new light or a different perspective on the incidents that occurred last Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the end of the day, we don’t have the answers … We’re looking to the Civil Grand Jury because it’s a fresh set of eyes,” Moore said. “We’re not looking to accuse anyone of anything, we’re just looking for answers, because we’ve had Deltopia for, what, a decade, and this is the first time this has happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenators proposed potential actions that the community can take in order to prevent future events from spinning out of control. Ideas suggested included enacting parking restrictions, blocking entrances to I.V. or making Deltopia an official, sanctioned event that could potentially make it easier to regulate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finishing the discussion about Deltopia, Senators went through details of the broken financial code in funding SJP. What initially occurred in the previous meeting was that the Student Commission On Racial Equality (SCORE) decided to allocate $250 for SJP for the group to transport a wall of photographs to the school. However, because SJP already received transportation funding earlier in the year in order to attend a conference, SCORE’S allocation broke code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Senate approved the allocation in their previous meeting, however, they had the power to choose not to correct the error and allow the group to keep the funding. A debate ensued on whether or not they should revisit the previous meeting’s minutes and correct the mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn-Campus Senator John Pena-Soriano said he felt Senators should allow the mistake to pass since the group had been operating under the assumption that they would receive the funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems like it’s really on us,” Pena-Soriano said. “I feel that it’s unfair for us to take away their funding now that we approved it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff-Campus Senator Derek Wakefield disagreed with Pena-Soriano. Wakefield said he did not have anything against the group or their reason for requesting funding, but he said he felt that Senators should abide to the legal code regardless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to follow policy, otherwise there’s no point in having policy in the first place,” Wakefield said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Senators voted to strike the funding from SCORE’s minutes, thereby revoking their previous approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis story is a \u003cem\u003eDaily Nexus\u003c/em\u003e online exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-11/a-s-senators-discuss-deltopia-misallocated-funding/","id":3027,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3026,3025,3024],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Veterans Fight for More Resources at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Veteran.jpg?resize=355%2C230\u0026ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Veteran.jpg?resize=520%2C300\u0026ssl=1","description":" It’s been nearly six months since former Special Forces soldier and current UCSB biology student Paul Malone embarked on his most recent mission to improve and expand the limited services offered t...","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"single-post-content\"\u003e\n            \u003ch2\u003eConditions Have Worsened, Frustration is Rising. Will the Administration Step Up?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been nearly six months since former Special Forces soldier and current UCSB biology student Paul Malone embarked on his most recent mission to improve and expand the limited services offered to veterans on campus. His plight has been an uphill battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs president of the Student Veteran Organization, Malone assists veterans in their transition from soldier to student and addresses the various issues facing the student veteran community, which is armed with meager resources. While university administration has promised forthcoming improvements, Malone said he has seen a stark contrast between what has been promised and what has been delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenges facing veterans were worsened when Jon Parra, a 20-year veteran of the military and the director of the independently funded Veteran Resource Team, resigned at the end of March. Malone attempted to explain some of the causes behind Parra’s departure, which eliminated UCSB’s last full-time staff position devoted entirely to veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wasn’t finding himself effective here, and the infrastructure, I suppose, isn’t in place for him to do the things that need to be done for him to start and maintain a successful veterans program,” Malone said. “Now there is no one dedicated full-time to veterans as there used to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration at UCSB’s climate for veterans is not an isolated phenomenon. Ph.D. student and naval veteran Delores Mondragon described her experiences at UCSB as “intolerable” and said she “faced assault and harassment for being a veteran.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere at UCSB, Mondragon studies Military Sexual Trauma, a term that references experiences of sexual assault or harassment in the military, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder, a debilitating anxiety disorder that follows an experience or witness of a terrifying, traumatic or tragic event, as defined by the American Psychology Association. When she reported an incident of being attacked and threatened, however, her fellow students mocked her, implying that her report was merely indication that she suffered from the very disorder she studied. Even when she approached the Title IX office at UCSB, she did not receive much consolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was hinted by fellow students that my reporting of harassment was a condition of me possibly suffering from PTSD. I reported the incident to Title IX and they could not do anything even though I was grabbed, cussed at and threatened with future retaliation,” Mondragon said. “But this was seen as an exaggeration, and when I reported it to the dean, I was ostracized because I took it outside of the department — I was told things get handled in-house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMondragon said she was only seeking the most basic level of courtesy and equal treatment for veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We just want to be treated as human beings,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis past week, the issue reached a critical point when Malone and another student veteran, Aaron Barruga, personally delivered a detailed and extensive list of grievances from the veteran community to the office of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The letter described “cultural, administrative and resource failures that have hampered the integration and success of our student veterans,” and outlined specific action that the university should take to correct these failures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recommended actions included implementing a digital tracking and record-keeping system for enrolled student veterans, hiring a new, full-time Coordinator of Veteran and Military Services and establishing mandatory veteran awareness training for faculty and staff, which is similar to training provided for awareness of other minority groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most urgent element of the letter regarded the appalling national rate of veteran suicide, which stands at about 22 people every day, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs. In other words, a veteran takes his or her own life every 65 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarruga, a former member of the military’s elite Joint Special Operations Command and current first-year economics major, explained the potentially deadly risks that are associated with not providing proper resources to “an entire demographic of students who are predisposed to testing positive” for PTSD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s such a pertinent issue because, if we were a Filipino culture club or whatever, the end state may be limited to, say, [the fact that] people would not appreciate our culture the way we wanted them to,” Barruga said. “Our end state is [that] a veteran is not going to feel socially accepted because he has PTSD. The culture here is going to unconsciously create distress for him and he’s going to go home and blow his fucking brains out. So our end state is very costly if we choose not to act.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClinical psychologist Kirsten Olson said it is essential for the university to provide additional services to student veterans, who she said are considered “non-traditional students” for a number of reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are older, they are more likely to have families and they are more likely to have other sorts of problems that our traditional college students don’t have,” Olson said. “They are also more likely to have lots of strengths and life experience that other traditional students don’t have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlson, who specializes in addressing PTSD issues in combat veterans, expressed support for Malone’s continued efforts for improvement, saying “there’s always more that can be done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that’s why Paul’s leadership has been so great, because he’s acknowledging, ‘Right, UCSB has done a lot, but there’s more to be done,’” Olson said. “He’s trying to raise that awareness — that these are the next steps that need to be done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone, members of the administration and the Veteran Resource Team have been working relentlessly to relocate the Veteran Resource Center from its current 10-foot-by-10-foot room to a larger area, specifically Building 434, a structure located near Counseling Services that has remained vacant for over six months for unspecified maintenance reasons. Their efforts finally paid off yesterday, with the university informing veterans that the building would be allocated to them. The new space is, according to Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead, more than twice the size of the current VRC, and could prove more accommodating to the population of more than 100 veterans and 350 veteran dependents on campus that it caters to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key concern raised by the letter was the amount of student veterans that have dropped out of UCSB since last year, which the letter stated was a quarter of the total student veteran population. In light of this number, the letter also stated that not enough efforts have been made to service student veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have failed to educate, protect, and empower student veterans, as a university,” the letter stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith such high drop-out rates, Malone said there is a lack of concern for retaining student vets, which he said would not be such an issue for many other underrepresented students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a lot of communities where it would be simply unacceptable to lose a quarter of the population — that’s huge,” Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmistead disputed the accuracy of the statistic by referring to veterans who delivered “statements of intent to register, but then did not enroll.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe that there was a misunderstanding on the numbers that the students were working with,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with her disagreement on the figures, Armistead said UCSB still needs to provide more to veterans on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do believe that we need to do a better job supporting veteran students,” she said. “The goal is to hire a coordinator that focuses on supporting veterans. I believe this focus will help with improving retention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral instances of potentially offensive and thoughtless language from university faculty was the final grievance expressed in the letter to the chancellor. In one instance mentioned in the letter, a tenured professor said of concerns surrounding student veterans and efforts to assist them, “What’s the worst that could happen? Suicide?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remark was made in the presence of a student vet, and Olson said such a statement runs contrary to the accepting and welcoming environment the university is supposed to hold for all students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We talk about having a climate of respect on campus and appreciating diversity, having respect for all different points of view,” she said. “But, making derogatory comments or dismissive comments about suicide — that wouldn’t be okay to say … in the Greek community in terms of fraternities or sororities. So why would it be okay to make dismissive comments about the veteran community?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the prevalence of suicide in the vet community is as concerning for vets, and should be treated as delicately, as it would be for any other student community, Olson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t say ‘Who cares?’ if a queer person kills themselves, so why is it okay to say ‘Who cares?’ if a veteran kills themselves? It wouldn’t be okay to say that about any of our valued community members.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Olson, Barruga said he found the comments unproductive and careless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you start saying stuff that paints this picture that veterans are damaged goods — they come from lower class, they’re uneducated, just shit like that — it doesn’t help,” Barruga said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the long list of grievances, Olson provided insight regarding the progress that UCSB administrators have made toward veterans’ issues in the recent past. For example, Olson said Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young has demonstrated consistent support for student veterans. Similarly, Executive Assistant to Chancellor Yang Diane O’Brien said members of the administration have, in fact, been working diligently to improve the state of affairs for veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not trying to make any excuses. We’ve been working really hard with Student Affairs to help solve some of their issues,” O’Brien said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether administration officials are indeed striving to improve the state of veteran affairs on campus or are engaged in conscious or unconscious negligence, a significant portion of the veteran segment in the student population continues to face a unique set of challenges. Speaking with many of them, it becomes apparent that some are dissatisfied with their treatment and experiences at UCSB. Still, according to Mondragon, they remain “skilled, responsible and prepared,” with a determination to work for a more equal system on behalf of their fellow veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\"\u003eThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"gallery-54777-1-slideshow\" class=\"slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery='[{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Veteran.jpg?fit=520%2C300\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54804\",\"title\":\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0079-e1397118822601.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54782\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0109.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54783\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0144-e1397118837242.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54784\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i1.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0176-e1397118853627.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54785\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMG_0240-e1397118874744.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54786\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/IMGP0553-e1397118980749.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54787\",\"title\":\"IMGP0553\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Picture-005-e1397118999361.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54788\",\"title\":\"Picture 005\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/Picture-135-e1397119012143.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54789\",\"title\":\"Picture 135\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"},{\"src\":\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/dailynexus.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/04\\/SANY0320-e1397119026534.jpg?fit=600%2C450\\u0026ssl=1\",\"id\":\"54790\",\"title\":\"SANYO DIGITAL CAMERA\",\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"itemprop\":\"image\"}]' itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhotos Courtesy of Paul Malone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA version of this article appeared in the Thursday, April 10 edition of the Daily Nexus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Other items discussed at the meeting included the resolution to provide trigger warnings in classrooms to trauma victims that has garnered significant media attention, continuing improvements to the Isla Vista Pardall Center, plans for a professional drag show sponsored by the Queer Commission and confirmation that The Fire Department will be playing at Chilla Vista.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore attempted to clarify police objectives regarding shutting down parties during Deltopia weekend in response to Senator Montana MacLachlan’s question asking what constitutes a “large party” in police terms. He said police personnel are not necessarily focusing on private house parties, but rather are concerned about large-scale, open-house gatherings or on-street crowding of over 500 people that can easily spin out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re worried about the stuff that spills into the street or is totally public where there is no monitoring of who is coming in,” Moore said. “Those parties that you can just walk into — that’s what they’re trying to aim at, they’re basically trying to shut down stuff like that that’s uncontrolled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore also said he advises party hosts to keep their music at relatively low levels to avoid receiving a citation for a noise ordinance violation. Unfortunately, according to Moore, there has been no stated decibel measurement of what constitutes as “low level” noise, so Moore suggests music players adhere to the rules from Halloween weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would stick to Halloween standards really, to be honest, as a precaution,” Moore said. “They make a judgment call when they decide to give you a ticket like that, so they’re not really able to tell us, which kind of sucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore then addressed concerns over newly-installed cameras in I.V. According to Moore, funds for the cameras were allocated by the university.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The security cameras are being paid for and provided by on the request of the university administration,” Moore said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenators continued to press for further information about the new surveillance measures. The lack of knowledge revealed that none of A.S. leadership was provided basic details of the new security measures that would be using school resources, such as who would operate and monitor the cameras, their costs or the duration of their implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore said he does not approve of the degree of secrecy with which the new surveillance measures were executed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think the way they put up the security should be more transparent,” Moore said. “There’s been no P.R. or attempt to explain what was going on… [and] all these things that are supposed to be part of a community discussion just didn’t exist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenators debated the legitimacy as well as the pros and cons of the new security cameras, with Off-Campus Letters \u0026amp; Arts Collegiate Senator Scott O’Halloran expressing approval of the cameras. O’Halloran cited recent incidents of assault and said the cameras could be a useful tool to track down suspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Instead of being uncomfortable with people watching you all the time, be like, ‘I’m uncomfortable because I just got assaulted and there is no justice for me,’” O’Halloran said. “It’s a serious thing. Maybe we should be less concerned with our privacy and more about somebody getting justice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollegiate Senator for the College of Engineering Amir Khazaieli delivered a rebuttal to pro-surveillance advocates, as he cited numerous studies of other surveillance systems, highlighting a controversial one in England. According to Khazaieli, the system in England showed that there was “no evidence that mass surveillance had reduced overall crime rates” and there was also “evidence of clear abuse” from police units to target minorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is considered mass surveillance,” Khazaieli said. “Some of the other places that have implemented stuff like this include the U.K., Iran, Russia, Vietnam, East Germany and Bahrain. … Places that have implemented video surveillance have shown and proven that it’s actually not effective.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhazaieili also said he stresses the importance of protecting I.V. citizens’ constitutional rights on individual privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think there needs to be a lot of definite rules and regulations set forth with this so that it doesn’t conflict with anybody’s Fourth Amendment rights,” Khazaieli said. “I think we should definitely take action on this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the discussion surrounding police security measures, Senate moved onto other topics, which included the restructuring of A.S. The restructure plan has been in the works for several months and faced several revisions, culminating in its passing on Wednesday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly 20 bills connected to the restructure were passed, creating major changes in the way the executive office operates. Such changes include eliminating certain positions of the president’s staff, consolidating others and reforming legislative boards and commissions. One restructuring bill authored by A.S. President Jonathan Abboud removed the powers of the A.S. president to select the editorial staff of \u003ci\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/i\u003e (\u003ci\u003eTBL\u003c/i\u003e) newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbboud said the changes to \u003ci\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/i\u003e would make the paper more autonomous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/i\u003e will be moved under the press council, like the [Daily] Nexus is,” Abboud said. “They’ll still be something that A.S. funds through a lock-in [fee], but it won’t be something [to which] I could say, ‘Well, I don’t want this editor to be the \u003ci\u003eTBL\u003c/i\u003e editor’ and not appoint them. That takes away that power of the president to manage the press. That was important for me to take out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso at the meeting, senators passed a resolution authored by Off-Campus Senator Beatrice Contreras establishing a committee to reevaluate the Isla Vista Master Plan in an effort to increase community influence on new building developments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also announced that students could bring their artwork to the A.S.

Crimes occurring later in the week included an arrest for unlicensed marijuana possession and the usual distribution of citations for minors in possession of alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Sergeant Rob Plastino, officers received a call early morning last Monday on March 24 from an individual reporting that a masked man went into his home and assaulted him with a machete. The suspect, Plastino said, was wearing a mask, hoodie and all black clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The victim said he was in his residence and while there, someone entered his house,” Plastino said. “The victim received a wound that was two inches deep and two inches long on his arm. It seems that he raised his arms to defend himself from the assailant’s attack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe victim then fled to I.V. Food Coop where he contacted the police. Plastino said the victim was transported to the hospital shortly after, and now the incident is facing investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call from a victim that stated his roommate punched him several times in the head. According to Plastino, deputies who arrived at the victim’s residence observed that he had “a large welt on the backside of his head,” although the man refused medical attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The suspect states that the victim was being disrespectful because he was having sex with his [the suspect’s] girlfriend in front of him,” Plastino said. “Because the victim wanted to press charges, the suspect was arrested and booked into jail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso on Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call that there was a large in-progress fight outside 6776 Del Playa Drive. When officers arrived, most of the crowd scattered except for one individual, whom deputies approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The suspect was found to be drunk in public and while being arrested, he started a fight with deputies and kicked a police sergeant several times,” Plastino said. “He was booked with multiple charges, including public intoxication and assault on a police officer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Friday night, deputies on patrol near Del Playa and Camino Majorca contacted four people sitting inside a car, smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol. According to Plastino, when an officer approached the vehicle and the driver rolled down the window, marijuana smoke emanated from the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The suspect had no marijuana license and the deputies determined that the passengers consisted of a 19-year-old male driver, a 23-year-old male sitting in the passenger seat and two 15-year-old females sitting in the back seat,” Plastino said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlastino stated that the 23-year old male was cited for multiple charges, including providing alcohol to minors.
