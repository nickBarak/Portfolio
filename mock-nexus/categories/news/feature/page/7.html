A littlenaked flying cherub babyis shooting harmless peoplewith a medieval war weapon toconfuse their sense of free willin commemoration of an entirelyunrelated Greek Orthodox traditionbased on the name of some saint? Yeah,fuck it, let’s celebrate. And while we’rerejoicing in our passions and love for ourcompanions, everyone else can just grab a tubof petroleum jelly and alternate between fits ofdepression and masturbation all day. Okay, beforewe get too cynical here about doves and rose petalsand gooey chocolate, I think it’s time we turned thatlonely-heart’s frown, upside-down.In the magical kingdom of Isla Vista, Valentine’sDay is an equal opportunity holiday. We can allhave our stupid heart-shaped expression candy andeat it too. I mean honestly, those littlesweethearts are quite theconversation starter inand of themselves. It’slike a cheaper wayto booty-call textthat also tastesdelicious— “kissm e , ”“ h o tstuff,” “sof i n e . ”It’s toogood not totake advantageof in some vulgar,offensive way.The following is a two-partguide to easy and fun ways to makeValentine’s Day well, easy and fun, whether you’rehitched or flying solo. Remember, Choose Your OwnAdventure books?If you want to see how to make the person you areexclusively sleeping with smile, go to option 1.If you want to see how to take advantage of the inevitableself-consciousness and loneliness this day spurns and casuallysleep with someone, go to option 2.1) Lovers, this is a day to rejoice and revel in yourmelting heart and regular lay. It’s a day to spoil yourmate and get spoiled back with yummy kisses anddiamonds and yachts. And of course, it’s a day tomake sweet, passionate love to your beau. So yourrapidly increasing college education fees are gettingin the way of buying that special gift? Well Yudof,you can ruin our bank account statements but youcan’t keep us from our romance!The beauty of love is, when it’s real, it can bedone and enjoyed on a budget. In the midst of aneconomic recession, there’s nothing more romanticthan thoughts from the heart — seriously. Writedown how you feel and seal it with a kiss, snuggle upand watch your favorite movies all night, relive yourfirst date or your first sexual experience together, meltdown some cheap chocolate for some yum and somefun. Keep it real boys, that’s all she wants. And girls,show him what you love so much about him and whyyou find him so sexy. Oh, and lingerie wouldn’t hurt.2) Ah yes, the party-of-one crowd. Well, you maynot be getting a box of chocolates or a love poem thisyear. But hey, love is in the air, so go outside andtake a whiff. I’m not saying you should be creepyand go out on the prowl for sad loners, but thebeautiful thing about Valentine’s Day is it remindsus of how nice it is to have someone to hold, andthe person you’re holding doesn’t have to be “theone” for you to feel good.Being single is fun and you can’t let this day makeyou forget that. I’ll be taking my valentine Mr. Vibratorout on a private date between my legs, and I’m notashamed of that. Couples get one day of the year to becute and sexy and romantic, and we singles get 364 toact randomly on our horny urges. Now I’m not usuallythe biggest advocate for having a fuck buddy, but comeon people, it’s V-Day! Find someone to hate love with;it may not be romantic but it sure as hell will be hot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36816\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36816\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-14/36816/","id":3537,"author":{"id":336,"name":"S.F."},"related":[3536,3535,3534],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Stakes Are High","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UC Administrators and State Leaders Gamble with Higher Education...","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"single-post-content\"\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlthough the state did not cut higher education spending in 2010-11 — Arnold Schwarzenegger actually increased funding to the University by $370.4 million — the state cut the UC by $305 million last year, $52 million of which was dealt to UCSB to reduce.

For years Governor Schwarzenegger dealt with enormous budget shortfalls using shady accounting tricks and cheap gimmicks designed to postpone the inevitable collapse until the next guy took office. Jerry Brown has shown incredible leadership on this issue by making the tough choices and putting the future of California above partisan rhetoric and special interests. This year California faces a possible $28 billion deficit, and Brown is proposing massive cuts to higher education and social services in order to close the budget gap, while still protecting K-12 schools. Meanwhile, Republicans are refusing to compromise and allow the state to raise new revenue. We can’t simply cut all $28 billion from the budget — we need to raise taxes. If we fail to do this we are placing the burden for our irresponsibility on our children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tWith nearly $1.4 billion being cut from higher education, Governor Brown is likely to lose a few supporters from the very students who helped elect him. But we should remember that a cheap education now isn’t worth the collapse of our public university system later. A university education is a tremendous privilege and is the gateway to personal economic success. I cannot in good conscience ask the working class to pay a gas tax so that I get a free ride through college. Education must remain accessible and as affordable as we can let it, but most importantly, it has to be sustainable.

I come from a pretty well-off family, so I did not need to worry about paying for my tuition. I allowed myself to be naïve for a while, not bothering to find out what was happening or why so many students were angry and frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tThe first time I felt affected by the budget cuts was when I couldn’t get a fourth class for winter quarter. I tried to crash a couple of classes, but there was already such a long waiting list — and I was so low in priority — that I did not come close to getting in. Taking a meager 12 units that quarter, I became distinctly aware of the affects the budget cuts were having. I saw friends who were pre-med not getting the classes they needed. They would tell me how if they didn’t get the chemistry class they are supposed to take, they wouldn’t be able to stay pre-med due to their inability to finish their course work on time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tWe hear a lot about how prices are going up and class spaces are going down, but we lose sight of how these budget cuts affect individuals going through the system. We lose sight of the girl studying to get into medical school who may not be able to pursue her dream because she is unable to get into a simple chemistry lab.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eMichelle Zaks is a second-year psychology major.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eZac Gates:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBudget cuts affect you, me and the world around us. They limit our potential by putting a cap on the resources available to us that we could have otherwise used to expand our intellectual capabilities. Luckily, I am graduating this year, so I will avoid a lot of the damage that will be done. But that doesn’t mean I don’t care for my fellow students. An education is something to be valued, and each student in this university has already demonstrated their commitment to their education by meeting university standards. It isn’t fair for us to fall victim to these cuts that are the product of somebody else’s fiscal irresponsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tBut as we were told when we were kids — life isn’t fair. In order to understand the university system, we must treat it like a business. Students pay their money for a service that is provided, that service being a quality education. The state government has no money, which means the university has no money. So in order to make up for this loss they have to make cuts in the university system, just like a struggling business would have to let some employees go. Don’t blame the UC Regents for this problem. Blame the Republicans and Democrats in the California government for treating the state budget as if they could just spend unlimited amounts of money without consequences. Hopefully we will soon realize that fiscal responsibility is more than just rhetoric.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eZac Gates is vice president of the UCSB College Republicans.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarly Bonilla-Flores:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe current UC situation is bleak and, like a collective waiting room, we’re anxiously preparing ourselves for an even bleaker future. Governor Jerry Brown, a UC graduate himself, announced under his proposed state budget a $500 million cut to the UC system. But wait — the UC regents just recently handed out incentive raises of more than $4 million. I can’t help but note the stark discrepancy between these two facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tI remember when Brown came to speak to UCSB before the gubernatorial election. It was exciting — UCSB was the first college campus he was visiting on his college tour and all the attendees, who not only included students but also UC employees, held up their “Jerry Brown for Governor 2010” posters with steady hope and optimism. During his speech, Brown proudly declared himself a UC graduate and spoke of the importance of supporting the university. So I ask now: With all due respect, Governor Brown, where is that support?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tThough what’s most shocking and distressing is that under Brown’s proposed fiscal plan, for the first time in the UC system’s 143 years of existence, the tuition payments made by UC students will surpass what the state contributes to the university’s general budget. At the same time financial aid is still being reduced and we, the students, are still living paycheck-to-paycheck hoping the ramen lasts the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tHere I am — the bearer of bad news — just letting you know how shitty your future is starting to look from here. Are you mad yet? What if I told you that the UCs in the following decade will have to turn away qualified students when demand for UC admission is the highest in the system’s history? How about this: there will be fewer classes, fewer professors and we will end up paying more for less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tClichés get a bad rap, but they exist for a reason. That is why I have no qualms about stating that we, the students, are the future. But the legislators are not giving a second thought to the disproportional cuts on higher education. There goes that future… \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tFun fact: Universities originated in the High Middle Ages period, not from the Church or the reigning political body, but by young people — students. I can’t help but feel a sense of obligation to those people, whose legacies remain solely in my opportunity to a formal higher education. This obligation has manifested itself in the need to promote knowledge and action. The legislative and higher education systems are in no doubt experiencing a state of uncertainty and change, but we the students are the ones left with the shit on our plates. I personally am not willing to passively clean up that shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\tHowever, as I walk the streets of I.V. all I smell is beer, weed and an overwhelming air of passivity. Keep drinking your beers, keep smoking that mary jane, but this passivity can’t go on much longer. There are organizations on campus such as CALPIRG that are actively trying to better this dismal situation. On Friday, Feb. 4, CALPIRG chapters across California are organizing a call-in day to Governor Brown. There is also going to be a rally for education on March 2 called Day of Action similar to the one held last year. My purpose is not to be solicitor, nor am I trying to make some grand generalization about the UCSB community. I simply believe that higher education is crucial to California’s long-term success, which is why we can’t sit on couches hoping for the best. That is also why, up until Day of Action for higher education, I am determined to learn more about what can be done on campus to change the current situation we find ourselves in, and hopefully at the same time motivate and encourage you to do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eCarly Bonilla-Flores is a staff photographer for the\u003c/em\u003e Daily Nexus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBob Samuels:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA recent Los Angeles Times editorial argued that the solution to the University of California’s budget problems is to reduce enrollments, but this suggestion would not only limit access to education when it is most needed, it would also hurt the funding of the entire system. Currently, undergraduate tuition is the only stable source of funding for the UC system, and the revenue generated by in-state and nonresident students subsidizes research, administration and most other UC activities. In fact, the university receives on average $23,000 from each undergraduate student (this includes state and student revenue) but only spends $8,000 on direct instructional costs. In other words, the university will generate more income if it enrolls more students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy increasing the number of international students and maintaining the level of resident enrollees, the UC could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars, while it supports its goals of access, affordability and excellence. This growth model would require hiring more assistant professors and lecturers, and for people who worry about undermining the research mission, it should be stressed that the more income generated by tuition, the more research that can be supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome have argued that the system does not have enough classrooms or facilities, but this is a false excuse. If the universities expand their hours of operations and have more evening courses, more students can be accommodated.  In addition, housing and dining are self-supporting and often produce profits so they can handle an influx of students, and let’s not forget that there are plenty of empty houses and buildings around our campuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key to this growth model would be a better balance between teaching and research, and this could be accomplished in two cost-efficient ways. The first step is to avoid the costly move to online education and to provide more opportunities for faculty members to teach undergraduate courses in their areas of specialization. The UCLA English Department has already moved in this direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother move would be to replace large courses with smaller seminars that allow for more student-faculty interaction. While this change looks like it would cost more money, it is often cheaper to have smaller classes due to the added cost of sections attached to large lecture classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the UC can increase its instructional quality, while bringing in more revenue, it can become a national leader in how to save our research universities.  All of the other options on the table call for a massive reduction of enrollments, layoffs, decreased opportunity and financial self-destruction. We can have improved access, affordability and quality if we make undergraduate education an essential priority.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eBob Samuels is the president of UC-AFT.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoug Wagoner:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is hard to overstate the gravity of the situation at hand. Governor Brown’s proposed budget includes a $500 million (approximately 16 percent) reduction in state support to the University of California. Furthermore, the governor’s budget assumes an additional $11.2 billion from a statewide initiative to renew an array of taxes scheduled to expire this year. However, currently there is no Republican support for this tax renewal. Consequently, it is dubious whether Brown can achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the legislature to put the initiative on the ballot. As Brown stated, failure to get the initiative on the ballot would likely result in a doubled cut to higher education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon releasing his proposed budget, Brown promised to work with stakeholders — including employees and students — to ensure that any cuts have a minimal impact on student fees and student enrollment. Pursuant to that statement, the UC Students Association (http://ucsa.org/) — the coalition of elected student representatives working on statewide affairs — was invited to a working group charged with the task of brainstorming options to meet the $500 million cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents have also been speaking out against the cuts to higher education during the budget hearings in the various subcommittees of the legislature. In addition, they are organizing on our campus and through the UCSA Board of Directors to communicate how devastating these cuts would be to the quality, affordability and accessibility of higher education in California. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the rhetoric of the Regents and the Office of the President who constantly trumpet the Blue and Gold Plan — an ostensible guarantee of a free UC education for Californians whose families make less than $80,000 per year — studies suggest that low-income students are increasingly deterred from seeking a higher education as a result of their inability to afford the net price of tuition. The UC’s recent history demonstrates that budget cuts result in fee increases, although fee increases have in turn yielded lower quality education. Brown’s proposed cut, which has nearly the same fiscal impact as shutting down a large campus like UCLA, will diminish quality and opportunity for California students through increasing student fees, increasing the number of out-of-state students, decreasing enrollment and cutting student services like Academic Advising, Counseling Services and tutoring, all of which are vital to student retention. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith over 40,168 UC and CSU students registered in the November election (over 8,000 of those were from UCSB!), it goes without saying that Brown owes his election in no small part to the votes of students from UC Santa Barbara. Moreover, given that students pay thrice to attend the UC through tuition, campus-based fees and taxes, we represent the number-one stakeholder in the future of this university. Educated young adults are tomorrow’s doctors, engineers and teachers, and accordingly the preservation of an accessible higher education is vital to the economic recovery of our state.

Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater -– something more consequential than party or political preference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are part of the American family.  We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, too, is what sets us apart as a nation.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, by itself, this simple recognition won’t usher in a new era of cooperation.  What comes of this moment is up to us.  What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe we can.  And I believe we must.  That’s what the people who sent us here expect of us.  With their votes, they’ve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties.  New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans.  We will move forward together, or not at all -– for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt stake right now is not who wins the next election -– after all, we just had an election.  At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else.  It’s whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded.  It’s whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are poised for progress.  Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back.  Corporate profits are up.  The economy is growing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone.  We measure progress by the success of our people.  By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer.  By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise.  By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the project the American people want us to work on. Together.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did that in December.  Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans’ paychecks are a little bigger today.  Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year.  And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we have to do more.  These steps we’ve taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we’ll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown.  You didn’t always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors.  If you worked hard, chances are you’d have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion.  Maybe you’d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat world has changed.  And for many, the change has been painful.  I’ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. I’ve heard it in the frustrations of Americans who’ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear -– proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re right.  The rules have changed.  In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business.  Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100.  Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there’s an Internet connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science.  They’re investing in research and new technologies.  Just recently, China became the home to the world’s largest private solar research facility, and the world’s fastest computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yes, the world has changed.  The competition for jobs is real.  But this shouldn’t discourage us.  It should challenge us. Remember -– for all the hits we’ve taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world.  (Applause.)  No workers — no workers are more productive than ours.  No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs.  We’re the home to the world’s best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea -– the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny.  That’s why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here.  It’s why our students don’t just memorize equations, but answer questions like “What do you think of that idea?  What would you change about the world?  What do you want to be when you grow up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe future is ours to win.  But to get there, we can’t just stand still.  As Robert Kennedy told us, “The future is not a gift.  It is an achievement.”  Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat.  It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now it’s our turn.  We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time.  We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.  (Applause.)  We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business.  We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government.  That’s how our people will prosper.  That’s how we’ll win the future.  (Applause.)  And tonight, I’d like to talk about how we get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.  None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from.  Thirty years ago, we couldn’t know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution.  What we can do — what America does better than anyone else — is spark the creativity and imagination of our people.  We’re the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook.  In America, innovation doesn’t just change our lives.  It is how we make our living.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur free enterprise system is what drives innovation.  But because it’s not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need.  That’s what planted the seeds for the Internet.  That’s what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS.  Just think of all the good jobs — from manufacturing to retail — that have come from these breakthroughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon.  The science wasn’t even there yet.  NASA didn’t exist.  But after investing in better research and education, we didn’t just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is our generation’s Sputnik moment.  Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven’t seen since the height of the Space Race.  And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal.  We’ll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology -– (applause) — an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, we’re seeing the promise of renewable energy.  Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company.  After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon.  But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard.  Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country.  In Robert’s words, “We reinvented ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves.  And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we’ve begun to reinvent our energy policy. We’re not just handing out money.  We’re issuing a challenge.  We’re telling America’s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we’ll fund the Apollo projects of our time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the California Institute of Technology, they’re developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars.  At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they’re using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities.  With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to get behind this innovation.  And to help pay for it, I’m asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies.  (Applause.)  I don’t know if — I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but they’re doing just fine on their own.  (Laughter.)  So instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they’re selling.  So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal:  By 2035, 80 percent of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome folks want wind and solar.  Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas.  To meet this goal, we will need them all — and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America’s success.  But if we want to win the future -– if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas -– then we also have to win the race to educate our kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about it.  Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education.  And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school.  The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.  America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.  And so the question is whether all of us –- as citizens, and as parents –- are willing to do what’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities.  It’s family that first instills the love of learning in a child.  Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.  We need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair.  (Applause.)  We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur schools share this responsibility.  When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance.  But too many schools don’t meet this test. That’s why instead of just pouring money into a system that’s not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top.  To all 50 states, we said, “If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we’ll show you the money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRace to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation.  For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning.  And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country.  And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that’s more flexible and focused on what’s best for our kids.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see, we know what’s possible from our children when reform isn’t just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities.  Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver.  Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado — located on turf between two rival gangs.  But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma.  Most will be the first in their families to go to college.  And after the first year of the school’s transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, “Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.”  (Applause.)  That’s what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child’s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom.  In South Korea, teachers are known as “nation builders.”  Here in America, it’s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect.  (Applause.)  We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones.  (Applause.)  And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, to every young person listening tonight who’s contemplating their career choice:  If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child — become a teacher.  Your country needs you.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the education race doesn’t end with a high school diploma.  To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American.  (Applause.)  That’s why we’ve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students.  (Applause.)  And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit –- worth $10,000 for four years of college.  It’s the right thing to do.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today’s fast-changing economy, we’re also revitalizing America’s community colleges.  Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina.  Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town.  One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old.  And she told me she’s earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too.  As Kathy said, “I hope it tells them to never give up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we take these steps -– if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take –- we will reach the goal that I set two years ago:  By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last point about education.  Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens.  Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.  Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities.  But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us.  It makes no sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration.  And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows.  (Applause.)  I know that debate will be difficult.  I know it will take time.  But tonight, let’s agree to make that effort.  And let’s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third step in winning the future is rebuilding America.  To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information — from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped.  South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do.  Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.  China is building faster trains and newer airports.  Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation’s infrastructure, they gave us a “D.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to do better.  America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System.  The jobs created by these projects didn’t just come from laying down track or pavement.  They came from businesses that opened near a town’s new train station or the new off-ramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo over the last two years, we’ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry.  And tonight, I’m proposing that we redouble those efforts.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges.  We’ll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] what’s best for the economy, not politicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail.  (Applause.)  This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car.  For some trips, it will be faster than flying –- without the pat-down.  (Laughter and applause.)  As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the next five years, we’ll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans.  This isn’t just about — (applause) — this isn’t about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls.  It’s about connecting every part of America to the digital age.  It’s about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world.  It’s about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these investments -– in innovation, education, and infrastructure –- will make America a better place to do business and create jobs.  But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries.  Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all.  But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.  It makes no sense, and it has to change.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo tonight, I’m asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system.  Get rid of the loopholes.  Level the playing field.  And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years –- without adding to our deficit.  It can be done.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home.  Already, our exports are up.  Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States.  And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs.  This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans — and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs.  That’s what we did with Korea, and that’s what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo reduce barriers to growth and investment, I’ve ordered a review of government regulations.  When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them.  (Applause.)  But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people.  (Applause.)  That’s what we’ve done in this country for more than a century.  It’s why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe.  It’s why we have speed limits and child labor laws.  It’s why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis.  (Applause.)  And it’s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law.  (Laughter.)  So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.  If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you.  We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I’m not willing to do — what I’m not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered.  I’m not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees.  As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients’ — parents’ coverage.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let’s fix what needs fixing and let’s move forward.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren’t buried under a mountain of debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago.  And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people’s pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in.  That is not sustainable.  Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means.  They deserve a government that does the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years.  (Applause.)  Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis freeze will require painful cuts.  Already, we’ve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years.  I’ve proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs.  The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I’m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without.  But let’s make sure that we’re not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.  (Applause.)  And let’s make sure that what we’re cutting is really excess weight.  Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine.  It may make you feel like you’re flying high at first, but it won’t take long before you feel the impact.  (Laughter.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, most of the cuts and savings I’ve proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget.  To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.  It won’t.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear.  I don’t agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress.  And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it –- in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit.  The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit.  Still, I’m willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year — medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations.  (Applause.)  We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can’t afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.  (Applause.)  Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break.  It’s not a matter of punishing their success.  It’s about promoting America’s success.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code.  (Applause.)  This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now is the time to act.  Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress –- Democrats and Republicans -– to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done.  If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me take this one step further.  We shouldn’t just give our people a government that’s more affordable.  We should give them a government that’s more competent and more efficient.  We can’t win the future with a government of the past.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV.  There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports.  There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy.  Then there’s my favorite example:  The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they’re in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they’re in saltwater.  (Laughter.)  I hear it gets even more complicated once they’re smoked.  (Laughter and applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we’ve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste.  Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse.  We’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years, and we’ll cut through red tape to get rid of more.  But we need to think bigger.  In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America.  I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote –- and we will push to get it passed.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the coming year, we’ll also work to rebuild people’s faith in the institution of government.  Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you’ll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history.  Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done — put that information online.  And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren’t larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this:  If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.  I will veto it.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 21st century government that’s open and competent.  A government that lives within its means.  An economy that’s driven by new skills and new ideas.  Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation.  It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges.  No single wall separates East and West.  No one rival superpower is aligned against us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion.  And America’s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity.  And because we’ve begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America’s standing has been restored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high.  (Applause.)  American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed.  This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq.  America’s commitment has been kept.  The Iraq war is coming to an end.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us.  Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we’re disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies.  And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad.  In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces.  Our purpose is clear:  By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency.  There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance.  But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.  This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead.  And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Pakistan, al Qaeda’s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001.  Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield.  Their safe havens are shrinking.  And we’ve sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe:  We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerican leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war.  Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed.  Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before.  And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just a part of how we’re shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity.  With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense.  We’ve reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas.  Around the globe, we’re standing with those who take responsibility -– helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power -– it must also be the purpose behind it.  In south Sudan -– with our assistance -– the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war.  (Applause.)  Thousands lined up before dawn.  People danced in the streets.  One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him:  “This was a battlefield for most of my life,” he said.  “Now we want to be free.”  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator.  And tonight, let us be clear:  The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must never forget that the things we’ve struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere.  And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families.  Let us serve them as well as they’ve served us — by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur troops come from every corner of this country -– they’re black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American.  They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim.  And, yes, we know that some of them are gay.  Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love.  (Applause.)  And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC.  It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past.  It is time to move forward as one nation.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit –- none of this will be easy.  All of it will take time.  And it will be harder because we will argue about everything.  The costs.  The details.  The letter of every law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, some countries don’t have this problem.  If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed.  If they don’t want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn’t get written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn’t a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution.  We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try.  We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible.  No matter who you are.  No matter where you come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat dream is why I can stand here before you tonight.  That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me.  (Laughter and applause.)  That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father’s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat dream -– that American Dream -– is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era.  It’s what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future.  And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology.  And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Brandon thought his company could help.  And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B.  His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment.  And Brandon left for Chile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour — three or four days at a time without any sleep.  Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued.  (Applause.)  But because he didn’t want all of the attention, Brandon wasn’t there when the miners emerged.  He’d already gone back home, back to work on his next project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd later, one of his employees said of the rescue, “We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.”  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do big things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream.  That’s how we win the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re a nation that says, “I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.”  “I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.”  “I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.”  “I’m not sure how we’ll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we’ll get there.  I know we will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do big things.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of America endures.  Our destiny remains our choice.  And tonight, more than two centuries later, it’s because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you.  God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEND   10:13 P.M.

The town is unruly, expensive and poorly maintained in many respects. In fact, at 62.5 people per acre, I.V. also has one of the highest concentrations of residents in California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStudents Want What They Want\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the student’s desire to live in Isla Vista,” Associated Students attorney Robin Unander said. “I don’t care if it is UCSB, SBCC or student-age person; there is a lifestyle here. A certain demographic wants to be near, wants to be a part of it. That’s what drives it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, Isla Vista is populated 96 percent by renters, 45 to 50 percent of whom are students due to I.V.’s proximity to UCSB and SBCC. According to estimates from the UCSB Campus Housing Office and Santa Barbara City College Housing Services, close to 10,000 UCSB students and over 600 SBCC students indicated in Fall 2010 that they lived in I.V., although the total number of students in the area may be as high as 13,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals — the largest rental housing provider on Del Playa — said Isla Vista exists primarily as a renter’s market because so many students have flocked to the area for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Unander, there are only a few options available to student tenants who find fault with housing options in Isla Vista: they can move out of I.V. or live in university-owned residences, either on- or off-campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But then you can’t drink, can’t party,” Unander said. “A lot of students in I.V. want to be at least a little bit involved in that scene.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who stay in I.V., then, Unander said, will often have to struggle with tenuous living arrangements and hefty rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t have a constitutional right to live wherever we want to live,” Unander said. “There are affordable places to live — you can go inland, Fresno, Bakersfield, etc.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, according to CHO Director Maya Salmon, there is no dearth of living space in I.V. High demand areas and not-so-high-demand areas, however see varied interest from renters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSBCC Housing advisor Amy Collins said I.V. can occasionally be less costly than living elswehere if students are willing to endure close quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes the rent in I.V. can be cheaper than downtown cause you can have a bunch of people living together, although the quality of the I.V. house may be worse than the downtown property,” Collins said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo Landlords Push the Envelope?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everything is black and white when it comes to legal conflicts between landlords and tenants in Isla Vista.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, in the majority of cases — sometimes due to grey areas of the law, other times due to student irresponsibility, Unander said — landlords are operating within their legal rights. However, some, she said, do truly have “no regard for tenant’s rights,” and take advantage of matters such as security deposit refunds, charges for repairs and student apathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGelb, who claims he spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on maintenance and upkeep for his rental properties, said some landlords in Isla Vista do the bare minimum to provide for their residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d be surprised how cheap people are,” Gelb said. “I’m not mentioning names, I would just simply state that there are some good ones and also some simply awful ones who aren’t trying to throw a dime into their place. Just like doctors, there are great ones and there are some that should be disbarred from their profession. “\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome run-down I.V. properties for example, Gelb said, have aluminum window frames close to four decades old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When owners don’t replace those windows, it becomes a real concern for female tenants worried about intruders,” Gelb said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that’s hardly news — complaints about the ‘sketchiness’ of Isla Vista landlords are made regularly by students, often centering on disputes over damages, security deposits, maintenance requests and rent. However, according to Unander only rarely do students turn their frustrations into legal action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnander, who has been assisting students with housing issues since she joined A.S. staff in 2003, said she has only seen about 25 students actually pursue their landlords in small claims court in her seven-plus years here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr, whose office oversees Isla Vista, said many students express their discontent about Isla Vista housing to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you have some negatives because so many people are living in small areas,” Farr said, “but one of the real frustrations is that I hear that a lot of Isla Vista housing situations are substandard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett Goto, a fourth-year hydrology major, said he has felt little effort from landlords to ensure a comfortable living situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel that landlords do the bare minimum to keep their properties in living condition,” Goto said in an e-mail. “[They] know that customers will continue to rent in I.V. regardless of how attentive or detailed they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, students are far from the best tenants.

Between 2005 and 2009, the American Community Survey conducted a five-year estimate of population, demographic and housing unit statistics for Isla Vista based on U.S. Census Bureau data. According to those results, an estimated 22,751 people lived in I.V. during those five years. And, while that filled just over 6,000 of the approximately 6,500 available housing units at the time, these numbers show that there is not a housing shortage in Isla Vista. However, pricing and other factors such as preferred location and the dynamic of your living situation can contrast with availabilities, so it’s wise to begin making plans for next year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!--Ad Injection:random--\u003e\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

All of our properties are new or newly remodeled with ample parking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals— the largest rental housing provider on Del Playa Drive— the street is notorious for its fast-paced party culture and beach views and is the first region in Isla Vista to book up every year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No college student wants to commute and obviously there are social implications [to living in I.V.],” Gelb said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGelb’s company, Del Playa Rentals, for instance, began accepting applications in November, and has already secured residents for the 2011-2012 school year at 34 of its 35 properties. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, application periods are also just starting for numerous housing options in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Options:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the CHO, student tenants in Isla Vista can choose to seek out apartments, duplexes, condominiums, houses, co-operative housing, sorority and fraternity houses, and UCSB-owned housing such as on-campus residence halls, off-campus apartments and family student housing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the ACS results, approximately 48 percent of Isla Vista residents lived below the national poverty level between 2005 and 2009, compared to the national average of just over 13 percent. However, 3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr said, the fact that most students make a very limited income likely skews those results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, the fact that nearly half of I.V. residents are UCSB students and that nearly half of I.V. residents were reported living beneath the poverty line emphasizes the struggle that most students face in keeping with the requirements of living and attending school in the area, not the least of which is the financial toll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn in-demand alternative to traditional residences, the Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative was formed in 1976 by a group of students with the intentions of providing low-rent co-operative housing and avoiding “slum conditions” in I.V. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApplications for the co-op, which presently either owns or controls four houses in Isla Vista, are accessible at sbcoop.org starting Friday at 12:01 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMembership services coordinator Josh Redman said the co-op is prized for its community values, relatively cheaper rent and personalized features such as the Dashain House at 6719 Sabado Tarde — designated as a vegetarian co-op.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a different kind of relationship,” Redman said. “There are no landlords, just a board of directors and staff. There’s still security deposits and there’s still damages that need to be paid for sometimes, but we try to have people address these issues before just deducting money from deposits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Redman, the typical cost of sharing a room in a co-op in I.V. is around $400 a month, in addition to a monthly room and board charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although we do charge for room and board, you cook and eat together so it ends up being cheaper than most other options in I.V. I believe our pricing is about 70 percent below market value,” Redman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong other options for residency, Isla Vista is home to privately owned off-campus residence halls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to the start of the academic year, the privately owned residence hall Tropicana Gardens purchased its neighboring competitor, Fontainebleu, gaining two new locations — one on 6525 El Colegio and another at 811 Camino Pescadero Road. The newly renamed “Tropicana Del Norte” (previously Fontainebleu) and “Villas at Tropicana” (previously the Fontainebleu Annex) are extensions of the Tropicana housing options in I.V. and have been renovated in anticipation of next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to its recent expansion, the Tropicana residence halls and villas will be making a huge change to its operation strategy next year, when it seperates housing for UCSB and SBCC students into Tropicana Del Norte and Tropicana Gardens, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e[media-credit id=16616 align=”alignleft” width=”247″]\u003ca href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rbg_10jan11_housing-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"388246954\" data-slb-group=\"31656\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"31666\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-13/sweet-home-isla-vista/rbg_10jan11_housing-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rbg_10jan11_housing-1.jpg?fit=862%2C870\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"862,870\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"22\",\"credit\":\"Photographer: Rowan Byers\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark II\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1294613650\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"25\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"10\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"rbg_10jan11_housing-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rbg_10jan11_housing-1.jpg?fit=248%2C250\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rbg_10jan11_housing-1.jpg?fit=862%2C870\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rbg_10jan11_housing-1-247x250.jpg?resize=247%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"rbg_10jan11_housing-1\" width=\"247\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31666\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e[/media-credit]\u003c/span\u003e“This way, all 500 SBCC students at Trop [Gardens] will be like-minded and staffing can be totally geared towards our CC students, and Trop Del Norte will likewise serve the UCSB students.” David Wilcox, Executive Director for the Tropicana Gardens, said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, the company that now owns all three Tropicana properties was heralded in the Wall Street Journal late last year as the real estate “deal of the week,” due to Tropicana Gardens’ nonexistent vacancy rate prior to aqcuiring it’s competitor, Fontainebleu, which had a 50 percent booking rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Wilcox, due to increased demand and the Tropicana’s populatrity, the newest properties expect to be at nearly 90 percent capacity for next year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRooms in private homes are scarce to non-existent in Isla Vista, largely because of required start-up costs up to several thousand dollars, although they appear as more common options in Goleta and Santa Barbara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a league of its own, the Greek system does offer housing to UCSB students, however students must be selected as pledges through a grueling rush process in order to gain a spot in the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, UCSB owns single student housing facilities both on and off campus, as well as two university-owned family student housing complexes on the West Campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePotential Legal Issues:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to securing a spot on a lease in time for next year, there is still plenty of time to take steps to protect yourself as a tenant in your current or future living situations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the California Tenant’s handbook, “tenants have basic legal rights that are always present, no matter what the rental agreement or lease states.” These rights include limits on the amount landlords can make you pay for a security deposit, constraints on landlords’ rights to enter rental units without prior warning, and the right to a refund of your security deposit after you moved, or at least a written explanation of why you wouldn’t be refunded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin Unander, a lawyer on retainer for UCSB’s Associated Students, also works for the Isla Vista Tenant’s Union, an A.S. group dedicated to ensuring and improving tenant’s rights in Isla Vista.

Every year, tech giants such as Intel and Microsoft, along with companies such as Panasonic and LG spend tens of thousands on setting up elaborate booths, some spanning multiple floors, to display their latest products and innovations. Also alongside these huge companies are hordes of smaller booths, some rented by individual entrepreneurs to promote their inventions, some manned by young companies trying to break into a niche market, but the largest amount are staffed by vendors promoting the dull but essential elements of the electronics industry, such as cables and batteries.

Every company that could show off a 3D TV was, from the over-the-top wall mounted TV displays of Panasonic and LG to the more low-key offerings of Sharp and others, it was almost easy to forget these companies had ever made anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of LG, there was a comical dichotomy between the energy and grandeur that went into showing off their latest TVs and the rest of their products.  Attendees lined up to don 3D glasses and view elaborate displays while workers scrambled to answer questions and show off the new devices.  Opposite the TVs was the other part of the LG booth, showcasing their newest refrigerator. With one lonely employee in front of an austere display, there was almost a feeling that LG itself had chosen to forget about their other product lines in favor of showcasing 3D technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the 3D TVs themselves, other companies rode the 3D wave with products such as designer 3D glasses to be worn over regular glasses and other 3D TV accessories including stereos and more.  Companies such as Canon and Sony also focused on their 3D camera offerings, trying to prove that 3D was not just for Hollywood or big TV studios, but also for your home movies and vacation photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most impressive 3D offerings that the show had was the technology to watch 3D without having to use glasses.  A few companies demonstrated familiar movies such as “Avatar” on these experimental displays.  While the technology is still somewhat rough — for example, the screens can only be properly viewed from a certain distance and height — the quality that these prototypes showed was impressive.  If you were to sit in the proper place, they achieved an effect somewhere between regular 2D television and full quality 3D. While the technology still has room to grow, it’s definitely something worth keeping an eye on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show also featured the newest in experimental design and integrated technology from auto manufactures such as Audi, Tesla, GM and Ford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudi showed off very slick displays they had integrated into the dash of their newest vehicles, capable of projecting information onto the windshield for a driver to view information without looking away from the road.  GM also brought their newest prototypes to Las Vegas: cars that can drive themselves and network with each other to form automated caravans that all follow a leader car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of everything else, CES had robots crawling all over the place, varying from a little device that cleaned windows by crawling up and down both sides of glass panes, to aquatic military drones.  iRobot showed off their newest devices, including a pool-cleaning robot and a nursing home robot that would provide automated care for residents.  This year saw a much larger focus on robotics than in previous years, with booths devoted both to individual components and finished demonstrations, such as a small robot that balanced on and rode a bike around stage.  Typically many of the smaller robotics offerings are not in the main hall, and it was interesting to see them closer to center stage this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCES was, as usual, chaotic, crowded and impressive.  Attendees took over Las Vegas for the weekend, making it impossible to go anywhere without seeing a sea of CES badges and suits.  Staggeringly large, the show is a great example of the industry as a whole, and this year the show was bigger, more crowded and flashier than the last few years.  Also worth noting was the large percentage of Chinese vendors at the show, not just showing off components in small booths, but exhibiting finished products such as TVs and laptops that were sleek, cheap and ready to compete in the global market. In keeping with annual tradition, the show offered a smorgasbord of the latest, greatest products, impressive innovations and the promise to tempt electronics consumers in 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: large;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBest In Show\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFord Focus EV\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFord premiered their first fully electric vehicle in their keynote on Saturday morning.  With a range of around 100 miles on a charge, and the ability to charge in standard 120v or 240v outlets, Ford has managed to take the practicality of the Focus to an even higher level.   Overall it’s an impressive vehicle, and Ford is looking at a release in the US sometime this year, with European releases in 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolaroid\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPolaroid premiered two interesting products, a camera being designed by Lady Gaga as part of a product line known as Gray Line, and a slightly less flashy portable photo printer with Bluetooth connectivity.  The camera has a real retro appearance, but with a beautiful screen and Polaroid’s iconic instant photos — now using an inkless technology called zink that prevents smudging and keeps the film small — it’s sure to find a market among enthusiasts.  The printer is marketed as a way to print photos from cellphones instantly without any computer, and unlike the camera, will be hitting shelves sometime this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaser Demonstration\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTaser’s products were basically what you would expect: self-defense devices that fire electrified probes to disable potential attackers.  Despite some variation in color and shape, Taser’s products stayed true to their roots.  However, the Taser booth will remain one of the most memorable of the show because they allowed attendees to volunteer to be tased as live demonstrations.  There are few more ringing endorsements for your product as a self-defense tool then watching a man groan to his feet and answer “How do you feel?” with “like s^*t” over the booth’s sound system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

But don’t think the zoo has to be a time sink — if you’re just in need of a refresher or simply short on time, the zoo features “Must-See” exhibits to cater to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30818\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/time-santa-barbara-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30818\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/time-santa-barbara-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/time-santa-barbara-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/time-santa-barbara-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-12-08/time-santa-barbara-style/","id":3530,"author":{"id":333,"name":"Alex Cooper"},"related":[3529,3528,3527],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Balancing Act: Working Mothers at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Laurel Wilder is the assistant director of Institutional Research \u0026 Planning at UCSB.

However, women at UCSB, especially those seeking tenured positions in the sciences, find that balancing children and a career can be a nearly impossible road to travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly seven of the top 100 paid employees at UCSB last year were women, and four of them work in the sciences, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. These male-dominated departments traditionally pay the most at UCSB, as they receive the most grants and other funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany think that women are less involved in these departments due to a lack of interest. But for the past three decades, the United States has made a concerted effort to attract women to the sciences and other competitive fields. Today, women earn over 50 percent of all Ph.D.s, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a 2009 study of the UC system by UC Berkeley and the Center for American Progress showed that women do not often attain academic research positions in STEM and, when they do, are more likely to quit before obtaining tenure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFindings showed that family formation accounts for the “largest leaks in the pipeline.” Women in the sciences who are married with children are 35 percent less likely to enter a tenure track job after receiving a Ph.D. than their male counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingle women without children are, on average, as successful as married men with children in attaining a tenure track position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Eileen Boris, feminist studies professor and hull chair, motherhood and the demands of STEM are often incompatible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Women have not been encouraged in these fields,” Boris said. “That’s partially because of the 24/7 kind of workload in which men more often have other household members to pick up the slack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane Mackie, a mother and psychology professor, is a testament to the difficulties of balancing a work and home life. UCSB hired Mackie in 1984, the same year she graduated with a M.A. and doctoral degree from Princeton University. Mackie waited until she had tenure and was a full professor before she had her two sons, who are now 11 and 14 years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s always a trade off,” Mackie said. “Instead of being a superstar professor and a supermom, you are sometimes stuck being a ‘good enough’ mom and a ‘good enough’ professor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Mackie, aspiring tenure-trackers must establish themselves in their field early on. However, with evidence that fertility issues and diseases such as autism are linked to giving birth at an older age, less women may be willing to delay child bearing in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackie added that even women who are established in their field and have strong support systems at home have difficulties managing their time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even with the most liberal, equal-minded guy, women still have the babies,” said Mackie. “There is no ‘good’ time for that in a career.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough some overcome the challenge of having families while working as professors and researchers, social norms prevent many females from acting competitively to get the best pay and the best jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUCSB regularly matches offers that professors get from other institutions. However, if UCSB is not interested in paying the employee more to keep them at the university, the individual has to take the new job. According to Mackie, many women are hesitant to consider moving their family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men are more likely to put themselves on the market,” she said. “I suspect that women don’t like to play that game as much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbara Prezelin is one of the top paid women at UCSB and a 37-year veteran of the Dept. of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology. She said that she has petitioned to receive earned bonuses, but added that many females do not act as aggressively to get higher pay when it is deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_30434\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]\u003ca href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1299171316\" data-slb-group=\"30428\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30434\" data-attachment-id=\"30434\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/ns4aug10_stemcell-7-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=1302%2C1090\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1302,1090\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1280341838\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"31\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=250%2C209\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?fit=888%2C743\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7-250x209.jpg?resize=250%2C209\" alt=\"\" title=\"NS4Aug10_StemCell (7)\" width=\"250\" height=\"209\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-30434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=250%2C209\u0026amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C857\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?resize=120%2C100\u0026amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NS4Aug10_StemCell-7.jpg?w=1302\u0026amp;ssl=1 1302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e[/media-credit]\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-30434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eA female scientist transfers cell media in a UCSB lab earlier this year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e“I do think that male colleagues are far more likely to self advocate for accelerations in promotions which leads to higher pay scales and/or go [through] the trouble to look for possible jobs elsewhere in order to leverage for higher retention pay,” Prezelin said in an e-mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Boris, all women in academia, regardless of what institution they work at, what department they are in or how aggressively they pursue fair pay, are at a disadvantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t that women are being discriminated against as individuals, it’s the way the structures are set up at this point,” she said. “The structures represent the ideal worker as the unencumbered individual. More men have been unencumbered individuals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, work cultures at UCSB were markedly worse for women a mere 14 years ago. In 1997, Professor Yolanda Broyles-Gonzales pressed charges against the university after a study showed that UCSB was the ninth worst offender of unequal pay for professors in the nation. Broyles-Gonzalez, who is now a professor at the University of Arizona, eventually settled out of court and became the first woman in history to win a gender pay equity lawsuit against the UC system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The lawsuit has been very important in my life, for many reasons. The outcomes were many,” Broyles-Gonzalez said in an e-mail. “One of the conditions of my settlement was the establishment of a Gender Equity Review at UCSB for women faculty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the settlement, administrators UC-wide have tried to reduce gender gaps and ease the strain on working mothers. But has it worked?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s only been in the past ten years that [work cultures have] changed here in the UC system,” Ricardo Alcaíno, director \u0026amp; title IX officer at the Office of Equal Opportunity \u0026amp; Sexual Harassment, said. “That’s because in the last ten years, there has been such a huge number of influx of not only females into academia and doctoral programs but also males that don’t want to give up their entire life. They want to be multi-dimensional, not one-dimensional.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUCSB initiated the Breastfeeding Support Program in 2007 with grant money from the Orfalea Foundation. Five private rooms on campus are available where lactating mothers can feed their children or access breast pumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s another way to encourage faculty … to get their child, nurse their child or another one of their spouses can come by with the child, they nurse and be on their way,” Alcaíno said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Liz Molina, Breastfeeding Support Program organizer and UCSB human resources office manager, approximately 30 women take part in the free service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is convenient and it’s a lot nicer than the other options where someone is pumping in the bathroom or in their car,” Molina said. “Pumping takes a long time … so you do want privacy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1991, the university’s children services expanded into West Campus. Today, the Orfalea Family Children’s Center and Infant and Toddler Center work with more than 200 children ranging from ages three months to five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeslie Voss, director of UCSB Childhood Care and Education Services, said 55 percent of the parents who bring their children to the centers are faculty and staff. Voss added that the center staff do what they can to help ease the strain on working parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Their children’s needs always come first and obviously are the top of the list of priorities,” she said. “But the demands of work, whether as a staff member or faculty … is very challenging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Voss, the centers cater to the needs of parents by extending hours during exam weeks, providing parent support groups and assisting families during times of crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcademic climates have also adapted to the needs of working parents. For example, faculty meeting times are no longer scheduled at 4 or 5 p.m., the prime time for picking up children from school. The university also “stops the clock” for those on the track to tenure, allowing individuals to take anywhere up to a year off in order to care for new children or elderly family members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, while Boris said UCSB has certainly made efforts to assist female faculty with children, it simply isn’t enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“UCSB is doing a good job in trying to stop the clock for those dealing with family pregnancy, taking care of newborns and adopting children,” Boris said. “But the work cultures haven’t changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackie added that the work climate has changed for the better in recent years, but that “little things … can make it harder.” She said that UCSB does not offer camps during most holidays and the university’s quarter system does not align well with other school’s calendars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much easier it would be to have spring break — or even one week of it — align with the kids’ spring break,” Mackie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilder said maintaining the current level of child care available for UCSB staff and faculty is imperative. She added that infant care is needed by many more UCSB employees. But, because infant care is high-cost and the university is dealing with a budget crisis, Wilder said infant care probably will not be expanded without a subsidy for the child care center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really think that if the UC system saw child care as an essential service it provides to its working employees and students, as opposed to operating the child care centers as business models, we could have more confidence in the continued high quality, accessibility and affordability of the care our children receive,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there is also a more personal side to the story. With her busy schedule, Wilder said having fun and enjoying family time is often lost in everyday endeavors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another challenge is the emotional question of whether we are doing the right thing, whether we are making the right sacrifice — sacrificing time home with the kids when they are young for working in a job I enjoy in order to make enough money to continue living in Santa Barbara,” she said. “That sometimes can be very stressful to reflect on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcaíno said although academia is rooted in male-centric traditions, systematic changes are inevitable with an influx of working mothers and a change in family dynamics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the next five to ten years, the cultures will start changing by the numbers — sheer numbers,” he said. “There will be a change in the chemistry of the culture.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"\u003e\u003ci class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003ePrint\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"sd-title\"\u003eShare this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sd-content\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-facebook\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-30428\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-twitter\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-30428\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-tumblr\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-reddit\"\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\"\u003eClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"share-end\"\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRelated\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e          \u003c/div\u003e","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-23/balancing-act-working-mothers-ucsb/","id":3528,"author":{"id":263,"name":"Lexi Pandell"},"related":[3527,3526,3525],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Excuse me, Mr. Regent, sir…","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Our editorial board is publishing this statement to the Regents in hopes of getting an important message through their thick skulls: California’s youth is barely able to attend the UC at present fee...","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"single-post-content\"\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003eOur editorial board is publishing this statement to the Regents in hopes of getting an important message through their thick skulls: California’s youth is barely able to attend the UC at present fee levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who cares?” You may say to yourself. “That’s been the case for the last two decades.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the UC we challenge you to go beyond. Don’t sit-back — reform is a participation sport, and you’re up to bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have entered an age where a student who wants an affordable education is considered an extremist.  Next generation’s UC students will pay more than their predecessors for less of an education than the system has ever offered. While the Regents of the University of California and their police cohorts might say that UC students are rebellious gits with no respect for bureaucratic procedure, they have criminalized our inherent right to learn and better ourselves through schooling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur campaign for education was never a radical request. In their fight for the right to education, California’s youth has never asked for more than they were entitled. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, to our dismay, the practice of denial and scapegoating has become a staple of behavior from UC leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe find it absolutely imperative to remind the Regents that the UC is a public institution, and that its mission is to provide an affordable quality education to those who qualify. The Regents have thus far failed in their pledge to adhere to the California Master Plan and support California students as well as uphold their right to an affordable, equal higher education decades ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday, students braved brandished weapons and pepper spray in a commendable but likely futile effort to return balanced decision-making to the UC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, in modern times, our students are persecuted, pepper-sprayed and taunted with handguns whenever they voice their discontent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt yesterday’s meeting, a police officer pulled a pistol on student protesters. While circumstances are still unclear, the fact of the matter is that a UC police officer pointed a deadly weapon at unarmed students whose only request was to be offered an affordable education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough police presence was requested in the case the protest went awry, yesterday’s violence between law enforcement and students is indicative of a larger desperation that has now enveloped the entire UC system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only did last year’s 32 percent fee increases break the bank, but Mark Yudof now proposes to add an additional eight percent to that number and raise the total cost of a public education in California to an unprecedented 40 percent over the last two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow far can our pockets stretch? How long can UC executives reach into them to pay for the state’s fiscal mismanagement?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe understand that money is scarce and times are hard — not just for the UC, but for the nation as a whole. However, this does not excuse a lack of UC investment into the classroom. We are the next generation, and we demand the same access to public education that was given to the generations before us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Board of Regents has consistently passed responsibility for this injustice onto the state, declaring their hands and tongues tied in addressing the matter. But denial can only go so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have some words for the UC executives who have failed to take the students’ interests into account: take responsibility for your failure to represent us in this economic crisis. Take responsibility for the overwhelmed parents and students, the poorly paid professors, the underfunded programs, the lack of campus resources and the packed classrooms. Recognize that you are indeed the upper echelon of a decision-making process that trickles down into real world consequences for all the students you pledged to serve when you took your position. Realize your potential to change the situation for the better and to ease the sting of the recession for California citizens who deserve an education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents: realize your responsibility to ensure that this change happens. Keep your elected representatives honest, both for your sake and the sake of subsequent generations. Silence is consent in this case, and unless you are enthusiastic about forking over more of your money to the UC Regents, we suggest you speak up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday’s protest was a wake-up call. It serves to remind us of the risks our peers are willing to take to ensure our right to an accessible education is still existent. The risks, consequences and future of a declining and unaffordable UC system are real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are delusional to appreciate the efforts of our UC leadership. Students have every reason to believe that we have been forsaken. The UC was once recognized as an accessible path to higher education; it was once considered an affordable option for a world-class education. Now, elitist values and exclusionary prices ensure that this education is only extended to the rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UC Board of Regents has failed you.

Photo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003eFor Adrienne MacIan, a 2006 UCSB Ph.D. student who wrote her dissertation on the celebrations, Halloween weekend is remarkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s an eventless event, and everything is done on the fly. It has a magical feel to it, like anything could happen,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others, such as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael Young, the affair is something else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate Halloween. Not so much the holiday or that people want to go out and have a good time. But I hate that thousands — or tens of thousands — of outsiders trash our community and houses and stress our emergency resources and then leave with us to deal with the debris,” Young said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWondering how to handle your Halloween? Read on to make your holiday weekend the best it can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Ray Vuillemainroy, there will be 150 deputies and officers on patrol in Isla Vista in addition to 10 mounted police units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The patrol will have mostly uniformed deputies, many of which are specially trained in crowd control,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Vuillemainroy also noted that there will be “plain-clothed” cops on patrol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVuillemainroy said students only have to act sensibly to stay out of trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be responsible. Have respect for others and, obviously, don’t indulge too much in alcohol. Basically, be responsible,” he said. “Everyone knows right from wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The main [policies] are still in place, that being the zero tolerance and the noise ordinance,” Young said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe festival ordinance, which has been in effect for 17 years, will be enforced from now until Thursday, Nov. 4. From 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. on the indicated days, no live or recorded music is permitted at a volume that can be heard from the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoise and festival ordinance violation fines range from $144 to $500, and any unpaid amounts will appear on your credit report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a slew of other laws that the IVFP will enforce. If minors are furnished with alcohol, the penalty is $1000 if the minor is aged 18 to 20, and $3000 if the minor is under 18 years of age. This fine is multiplied by the number of minors attending a party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossession of an open container will cost you $102 to $500, and Minor in Possession penalties are $500 and a one year driver’s license suspension. If you’re caught drunk in public, you’ll pay anywhere from $525 to $1000, and public urination has a $270 standard fine upon first conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you plan on having any out-of-town friends visit, check your lease first. Many landlords include a Halloween clause that bans overnight guests, alcohol or parties during the holiday weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Social Host Ordinance is already in effect in Santa Barbara County, Vuillemainroy said the IVFP will not enforce it until December.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were concerned about the crowding. If you were someone who lived on DP or Sabado Tarde and wanted to get to your apartment, good luck,” Michelle Morgante, UCSB alumna and former Daily Nexus news editor, said of the Halloween in the late ’80s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much has changed since then. However, in recent years limits have been instated to prevent some of Halloween’s past problems with street overcrowding and illegal parking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll cars on the 6500-6700 blocks of Del Playa must be off the street by 3 p.m. on Friday and can return at 6 a.m. on Monday. A number of entrance points to Del Playa, Sabado Tarde and Trigo Roads will be blocked to all incoming traffic for the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampus parking permits for Halloween, which also act as a Night \u0026amp; Weekend Pass for the rest of Fall Quarter, are available online for $17.50 plus a $5.95 shipping cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery year, Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital is overwhelmed by the volume of alcohol-related accidents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re overrunning the hospitals. The emergency rooms can’t handle the alcohol poisonings and other cases that come about [every year],” Young said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcohol poisoning signs include the inability to wake up, vomiting while passed out, slow or irregular breathing, extreme confusion and pale skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a friend is displaying these signs, call 9-1-1. Do not let the person fall asleep and do not induce vomiting. Turn the person on their side to prevent choking should they vomit and stay calm until authorities arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if a person does not die from alcohol poisoning, they can suffer irreversible brain damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UCSB Alcohol \u0026amp; Drug Program Web site recommends that students “eat a good dinner and continue to snack throughout the night, alternate one alcoholic drink with one non-alcoholic drink and avoid drinking games or shots” as a way to drink safely and avoid a hangover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do wake up with a hangover, it is important to eat a healthy meal as soon as you can, drink plenty of water or juice and avoid excessive amounts of caffeine. Rehydrating and nourishing your body will get you back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhandy Siordia, major events coordinator for A.S., said keeping drinking under control prevents reckless behavior that could get you arrested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People do crazy things while under the influence,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor decades, Halloween has seen an elevated number of sexual harassment cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There would be blocks where you would get grabbed, absolutely, if you were a woman…it was completely person-to-person, elbow-to-elbow,” Morgante said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanielle Mayorga, co-chair for Take Back the Night and fourth-year communication and linguistics major, said her group is working to prevent sexual violence on Halloween.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a huge trend around Halloween where there’s a high number of sexual harassments but also sexual assault,” she said. “Things that I’ve seen on the streets on Halloween are people grabbing other’s asses or, if there’s a scantily clad person, people will grab them or make comments at them. Both are examples of sexual harassment and assault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny physical contact or sexual act without a clear, consensual “yes” constitutes sexual violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People have the right to wear whatever they want, however little they want, and it is not an invitation for people to grab them, harass them or rape them,” Mayorga said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMayorga recommended that any rape victims call the 24-Hour Rape Crisis Hotline at (805) 564-3696 for guidance immediately following an attack. She also noted that the UCSB Women’s Center provides free and confidential counseling for both sexual assault survivors and friends of the victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough there are a number of police and paramedic stations located around I.V. for the weekend, Mayorga said that contacting authorities is, ultimately, the victim’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a very large trend of survivors choosing not to report, due to a number of different reasons,” she said. “…They experience a loss of power, [and] being able to restore that by choosing whether you want to see a police officer or talk to a counselor is the survivor’s choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExternal Vice President of Local Affairs Cori Lantz and A.S. coordinators are throwing a Halloween Film Festival at People’s Park in Isla Vista. The event will last throughout Saturday evening and will alternate between showing “Beetlejuice” and “The Ring” from 8:00 p.m. to 2 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Lantz, the gathering will include free water, coffee, snacks and condoms in addition to access to restrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope people come to watch movies, but I want them to know that there is a place for them if they need to sit down, use the bathroom or get water,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLantz said she estimates that 200 to 300 people will attend over the course of the eight hour event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, an Adopt-A-Block group will clean-up the streets from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday.

And then they leave,” Young said. “That’s the problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery year, the state and county spend upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars on policing, paramedics, hospital emergencies and other costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have hundreds of police and dozens, if not hundreds of emergency personnel. This is all happening because of people who decide to come here and do that to us. As a citizen of this community, it frankly pisses me off that these people feel like they can come here, trash it and then leave me with the bill,” Young said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYonie Harris, UCSB Dean of Students, said money could easily be conserved if the Halloween celebrations are limited to locals only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What really upsets me and has always upset me is the waste of tax dollars — in a time like now when the state, county, and university are in a financial crisis, it is quite unfortunate that we have to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on public safety, clean up, transportation, medical support, etc. for a big party that centers around drinking,” she said in an e-mail.  “I can think of so many other things that those resources could be used for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacIan said that, ultimately, it is the students’ responsibility to keep Halloween safe and fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For people in I.V., if you want [Halloween] to be good, then make it good.

in Isla Vista in a 1992 Daily Nexus article. “‘[In the late 80’s] though, people from out of town came to party and trash the town, they didn’t really care. They were going to be here for one or two days and go home.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a 1993 Santa Barbara County Action Plan Report, people from Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and all over California flocked to the area for the weekend-long celebration. Over 70 out-of-town schools were represented among the arrested and cited students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For young people in the age group of 14-26 years, Isla Vista has become ‘the place to be’ on Halloween,” the report said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Big, Destructive and Dangerous”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe early 90’s saw a huge increase of Halloween attendees, accidents and arrests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Young, vice chancellor of Student Affairs, said he had heard rumors of the wild revelry when he started working at UCSB in 1990.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Halloween celebrations had gotten way too big, destructive and dangerous,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Office of Student Life administrative files, 853 of 25,000 attendees were arrested in 1991. Of the offenders, 80 percent were out-of-towners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat same year, two people fell off the cliffs and two deputies were injured while on duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite growing concern from the community, Halloween of 1992 fell on a Saturday and no serious moves were made by the county or university to stop the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat year also had the second most arrests and citations in Halloween history — 1,090 out of 40,000 attendees, 95 percent of which were for alcohol violations. Again, two people fell off the cliffs, including a teenager who fell 65 feet from the 6600 block of Del Playa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Santa Barbara Sherriff Summary Reports, Halloween 1992 cost the county approximately $100,000 in law enforcement overtime alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a particularly bad Halloween that year [1992] and a decision was made, and made by the county, that they needed to, if not put an end to it, then certainly bring it down to more acceptable levels,” Young said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Caused The Change?

Major television newscasters and publications such as Playboy magazine did extensive coverage of the ‘party,’” the letter said. “Halloween evolved from a local holiday spirit event to the largest college party in California.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA number of Daily Nexus articles in addition to reports in the La Cumbre yearbook and The Santa Barbara News-Press also attributed the spike in attendance to a mid-80s Playboy article that listed Isla Vista as a top spot to celebrate Halloween.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile researching for her 2006 dissertation on Halloween in I.V., then-UCSB Ph.D. student Adrienne MacIan said she encountered a number of interviewees who noted that the infamous magazine was instrumental in the weekend’s infamy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone told me, ‘Things got really out of control after that Playboy article,’” MacIan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a Daily Nexus poll issued last week, 52 percent said they thought Halloween in IV became a renowned event “In the late 80’s after Playboy ran an article on the event.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn actuality, the article is nothing more than an urban myth.

None had seen the actual article in the magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to MacIan, a student most likely perpetrated the rumor as a practical joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was a whole urban legend built up around this thing that nobody ever bothered to check,” MacIan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Five Year Plan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We, at times, had busloads of people from other campus come here, get trashed, trash the place…and then leave,” Young said. “…What I felt, and what certainly many people in the leadership community felt, was that we should not encourage people to be here and we should warn people that the county had made a set of judgments that it was no longer going to tolerate certain kinds of behaviors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Santa Barbara Grand Jury issued an investigation and, subsequently, recommended that the Board of Supervisors take action to halt the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…Many county government officials recognized that the Halloween ‘college party’ in Isla Vista was no longer an event that can be sanctioned, condoned, chaperoned or tolerated by this County,” a 1993 County Action Summary Report said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal law enforcement drafted the “Five Year Plan” to limit the number of revelers that flocked to I.V. the next Halloween weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe procedure included a “no tolerance policy” in addition to a festival ordinance that forbade outdoor music from 6 p.m. onward during the weekend, the confiscation of any costume prop that could be used as a weapon, barricading five main entrances into Isla Vista, restricting parking on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde from Oct. 29 until Nov. 1 and implementing pre-Halloween regulations as early as the first week of September.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arrests were up, citations were down and Isla Vistans agreed it was a very different Halloween experience from years past…” Brett Chapman wrote in a 1993 Daily Nexus article. “Operational changes for 1993 included making custody arrests whenever possible, exacting higher fines for infractions and strictly enforcing a ban on live and amplified prerecorded music.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether increased police presence or the fact that Halloween fell on a Sunday was more influential, the weekend saw only approximately 25,000 partiers. According to Office of Student Life files, 966 arrests were made, of which 93 percent were out-of-towners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome students reacted against the new regulations and there were rumors that an abandoned apartment complex on Del Playa would be the target of arson on Halloween weekend. However, overall, reports noted that “officers observed a compliance to the laws and ordinances that were being enforced.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 1993 onward, the numbers of attendees decreased and stayed low for almost a decade. In 1995, only 1,750 joined in the notorious street party, and both the administration and county officials started to think that the final nail was in the coffin for Halloween altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it actually had an effect for a couple of years,” Young said. “But then the activity and the numbers began to creep up again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e[media-credit id=13831 align=”alignleft” width=”163″]\u003ca href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"298412871\" data-slb-group=\"28206\"\u003e\u003cimg data-attachment-id=\"28208\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-26/biggest-college-party-california-history-isla-vistas-halloween-pt-2/cop_gives_ticketjs/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=2175%2C3316\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2175,3316\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=164%2C250\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS.jpg?fit=672%2C1024\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cop_gives_ticketJS-163x250.jpg?resize=163%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"cop_gives_ticket(JS)\" width=\"163\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-28208\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e[/media-credit]\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHalloween On The Rise\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly 10 years after the “Five Year Plan” was first implemented, 40,000 flocked the streets to celebrate Halloween — the same number of people that were at the disastrous 1992 event that initially inspired the stricter enforcements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Chancellor Henry Yang, the number of attendees varies greatly depending on what day Halloween falls on. Halloween 2003, for instance, fell on a Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Halloween celebration in Isla Vista does change from year to year, partly in response to whether Halloween falls on a weekend,” Yang said in an e-mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung speculated that other factors may have a hand in Halloween’s resurrection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Frankly, I think the internet and Facebook and the ability of people to communicate and for ideas to go viral and for whole communities of people to find out about something … it sort of catches on,” he said. “I think that there’s something to be said for modern social media. I think that the press also continues to dredge up things … up until recent years, people felt compelled to drive trucks up from Los Angeles to here to broadcast about Halloween.
